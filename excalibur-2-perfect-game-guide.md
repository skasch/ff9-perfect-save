#### Version X Notice

Following the discovery of the 10th Promist Ring by Vizuino back in 2011, and the Nero Family side-quest by The_Kusabi_ in summer 2013, a major revision to the walkthrough was needed. And this here is it.

Thanks to the pioneering refinements introduced by camdad04 and fine-tuning by NBtheGameMaster and IllusionGamer90, it is now possible to not only get the 10th Promist Ring, but also complete the time-consuming Nero Family side-quest, **and** do it all on the **Combined** stats path for those who prefer that one. It's very difficult, but it's possible.

This update has been a huge project, and it would not have been possible without the incredible amount of help and effort from several amazing and dedicated individuals. Special thanks go out to (in alphabetic order, trophies in the credits!):

* camdad04
* IllusionGamer90
* monkeyslinger
* NBtheGameMaster

Barring minor corrections/improvements, no further revisions are expected. So don't go discovering any new stuff, because I want to move on with my life!!! <___>

#### Notice to PAL Players

Contrary to what has been written here for the past several years, completing the challenge on the PAL version of the game is in fact possible. However, it is extremely difficult.

# Introduction

> Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives.
>  
>  *a mysterious* William A. Foster

The Excalibur II Perfect Game is the ultimate attempt at completing a perfect save file in Final Fantasy IX. Contrary to initial impressions, the Excalibur II &ndash; obtainable in Memoria only within 12 hours of starting the game &ndash; and a completionist playthrough are not mutually exclusive.

Perfection is the highest level of quality and that is what this guide will direct you toward; a quality perfect playthrough of the game. This entails:

#### High Intention: You aim for the top

I took a no-compromises approach to this game. So will you. That's why it is called the *Excalibur II* Perfect Game. Your perfect save will include the Excalibur II and you won't forfeit anything in order to get it. You will miss nothing, you will obtain everything. Those are the conditions and they are well within reach. Obsessive-compulsive and anal-retentive qualities will prove advantageous.

#### Sincere Effort: You don't give up

This is no FAQ &ndash; this is a *challenge* guide and it earns that name. A perfect game at Lv 1 within 12 hours? *Bring it on*, you say. Successful candidates shall demonstrate an above-average ability in the art of Soft Reset as well as have patience stats through the roof.

#### Intelligent Direction: You're looking at it ;)

You're in luck &ndash; 8 years' worth of planning, testing and optimization has already been done for you and is at your fingertips. Just connect the dots and you're there.

#### Skillful Execution: u r l337

While the end result of this endeavor will resemble a completionist's playthrough merged with a Lv 1 game, the road to getting there is decidedly a speed run incorporating both of the above. Everything which can be permanently missed in a perfect save must be completed within 12 hours. Practice makes perfect but a certain degree of speed run ability is required as time is unforgiving.

#### Wise Choices of Many Alternatives: You know what you want

Perfection is ambiguous. Ironically, it is not the Excalibur II which keeps the Final Fantasy IX perfect game from having an objective standard - it's the unavoidable EXP and your personal definition of *perfect* stats. There are a number of options to choose from and in the end, none of them are inherently better or worse than the others, it's just that there is no one, single correct way. For the indecisive, this challenge ends at the start of Disc 3, so decision time will come sooner or later. 

Get ready for one of gaming's best perfect game challenges; here we go!

# Main goals of this challenge

Not everyone has the same idea about what constitutes a perfect save. Some are satisfied with getting all items, others with learning all abilities and still others with getting max stats, or any combination of these ideas and more.

Therefore, this guide includes all goals which you may want in your perfect save, and all are accounted for simultaneously. This means that you can complete all of the goals below using this walkthrough; compromise was not an option when I set about doing this, and it should not be for you, either. That said, here is a rundown of the goals which you will be guided toward for a perfect save, with precise explanations below:

## Obtain perfect amounts of all missable items!

##### What is a *missable item*?

A missable item is an item which can no longer be purchased on Disc 4, for example because the shop selling it has changed its inventory or because it is no longer accessible. Once you reach Disc 4, you're left with whatever amount you bought before, if any, and any amount you may find/have found from chests or field icons.

##### What is the *perfect amount* to have?

The general consensus is that this is the highest non-arbitrary amount which can be gotten under the constraints of this challenge, i.e. the 12-hour time limit during which you need to reach Disc 4 and are therefore cut off from all the sources of the missable items.

Specifically, this means *numbers which can be equipped + 1 copy for your inventory*. The former part is clearly the minimum which you should have for your perfect save. The maximum would be 99 (excluding the impractical option of keeping as many as possible equipped and then buy 99). However, this is impossible to achieve for all missable items during this challenge, and any amounts below 99 yet above *number of users + 1* will be arbitrary.

The only amount higher than the minimum which still has some meaningful (i.e. non-arbitrary) use is the above-mentioned *number of users + 1 copy for your inventory*. This also avoids the problem of maximum amounts of (missable) synthesized items with missable inputs, the most notorious being Javelin + Silver Gloves = Save the Queen, where all 3 are missable and thus you can't have 99 of all 3 simultaneously.

##### So which items are missable and how many do I need?

There are 31 items which can no longer be purchased on Disc 4. Of these, 9 are used as synthesis inputs, making another 8 items potentially missable. And 2 of these are needed for further synthesis combinations, which adds 2 more to the count, for a grand total of 41 missable non-unique items in FFIX.

There's no need to buy any of the synthesized items since they can all be purchased on Disc 4 as long as you have the inputs. This means that you only need to buy the 31 basic missables in the right amounts, and can leave the rest of the work for after the challenge. The table below gives an overview:

| Key   | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **P** | Amount needed for perfect amount (character + 1) |
| **S** | Amount needed for synthesis of (item) |
| **B** | Amount bough in (location) |
| **F** | Amount found or otherwise received in (location) |

## Obtain maximum amounts of all missable unique items!

##### What is a *unique item*?

A unique item is an item which is available in a finite quantity no matter how long you play or what you do. Most cannot be bought, and if they can, then only in a limited amount. Naturally, we will want all of these unique copies in our perfect save, and so we'll need to acquire all of the missable ones on the way to the Excalibur II.

##### Why not perfect amounts?

With the exception of one very notable case, there is little reason to differentiate between maximum and perfect amounts with regard to unique items because all the maximums are less than the perfect amount (or equal in the case of the Blood Sword).

##### So what's the *very notable* exception?

Promist Ring. It can be won from the Auction House as long as you don't have any in your inventory. This means you can get a total of 9 copies from the Auction House (equip one on each character and buy 1 more). However, 1 more copy is found in the Desert Palace. So if you buy all 9 from the Auction House before heading to the Desert Palace, you can have a total of 10.

The problem here rests in the idea that getting 10 of this one specific item is seemingly inconsistent with getting *number of users + 1* or all the rest whenever possible. This might make the 10th copy seem pointless. 

However, *number of users + 1* is not actually the overarching goal, the aim is to have the *highest possible non-arbitrary amount*. In the case of Promist Ring, this is 10, since it's the maximum possible amount (and therefore not arbitrary - unlike 10 Power Belt, for instance). In the case of all other non-unique items, this is *number of users + 1*, the next best thing after 99. And in the case of unique items it's whatever amount is available since they are less than *number of users + 1* anyway (or equal in one case).

Another way of looking at it is that Promist Ring is a special case because:

* it's not *normal*: you can't have 99 and there are conditions on purchase,
* it's not *missable*: it is available even on Disc 4,
* it's not *unique*: it can be bought, sold, and re-bought infinite times.

However, the 10th copy is both missable and unique! If you don't get 10 on Disc 3 then there is no way to have 10 on Disc 4. And if you sell the 10th copy at any time (even on Disc 3), it's gone forever. Therefore you can treat the 10th copy as a missable unique item, and the 9 others as the requirement for acquiring and keeping it.

##### OK, so what are all the unique items and where/how do I get them?

The following table lists all the missable unique items, their maximum quantities and where to get all the copies. Non-missable unique items, such as ultimate weapons and items such as Hammer, are not included since they're not really relevant to the main challenge.

| Item | Quantity | Location |
|------|----------|----------|
| Blood Sword | 2 | Stolen from Tiamat<br/>Stellazzio reward |
| Genji Helmet | 2 | Stolen from Kraken<br/>Mountain Crack on northeast of Forgotten Continent |
| Genji Gloves | 2 | Stolen from Lick<br/>Foaming Water at southern tip of Forgotten Continent |
| Genji Armor | 2 | Stolen from Maliris<br/>Chocograph Treasure #21 - Outer Island |
| Ribbon | 4 | Given to you by Mog in Mount Gulug<br/>Treno Auction House item<br/>Given to you by Stiltzkin after buying all his deals<br/>Chocograph Treasure #24 - Forgotten Island |
| Dark Matter | 3 | Treno Auction House item<br/>Stolen from Ozma<br/>Dropped by Ozma |
| Running Shoes | 4 | Dropped by Tantarian<br/>Won by defeating Amdusias in the Treno Weapon Shop<br/>Stolen from Hades<br/>Found in the clock in Quan's Dwelling |
| Pumice | 1 | Dropped by Ozma |
| Pumice Piece | 3 | Dropped by Ark<br/>Stolen from Ozma<br/>Chocograph #22 - Outer Island 2 |
| Rebirth Ring | 2 | Award for winning the Tetra Master Tournament<br/>Chocograph Treasure #24 - Forgotten Island |
| Diamond | 3 | On the boat in Conde Petie<br/>Included in Stiltzkin's Bran Bal deal<br/>Chocograph Treasure #17 - Sea at Dusk |
| Emerald | 2 | Given to Freya by the Priest of Cleyra<br/>Included in Stiltzkin's Oeilvert deal |
| Ruby | 2 | Received when breaking the seal on the Iifa Tree<br/>Included in Stiltzkin's Alexandria deal (Disc 4) |
| Moonstone | 3 | Reward for impressing all 100 nobles<br/>Conde Petie Mountain Path colored stones puzzle<br/>Included in Stiltzkin's Alexandria deal (Disc 4) |

###### Notes

Some unique items can be synthesized using other unique items. The quantities provided are maximum quantities without synthesis.

There is only 1 Dragon's Claws in the entire game, so do **not** use the Dragon's Claws in a synthesis combination with Tiger Fangs to get Duel Claws. 1 copy of Duel Claws can be stolen from Deathguise. So, you should have 1 Dragon's Claws and 1 Duel Claws in your perfect save.

Some of the gems are also temporarily gotten during the Friendly Monsters side-quest, but they cannot be kept without leaving the side-quest incomplete. Those copies are therefore not included here.

Ozma holds 4 unique items; 2 Dark Matter, 1 Pumice and 1 Pumice Piece. You must steal a Dark Matter and a Pumice Piece, then end the battle and hope that Ozma drops **both** a Dark Matter and a Pumice. If not, you will have to reset and try again.

## Loot all missable chests and search all missable field icons!

Since we're going for perfection, we'' want to open all the treasure chests in the game, as well as search all field icons, i.e. the exclamation marks which appear over Zidane's head when he stands near a treasure. Furthermore, you'll be able to collect the Rank S Medal if you do this, which is likewise essential for a perfect save.

However, you'll mainly loot only the missable chests and field icons during the course of this challenge. There really are a lot of them and there's no reason to waste time picking up the non-missable treasures if they aren't useful. Time does really add up doing this!

You can find a complete list of all the game's chests and field icons, with locations and missability, in the Treasure Locations section.

## Obtain all missable key items!

There are 13 missable key items in the game:

* Autograph
* Moogle Suit
* Gizamaluke Bell
* Yellow Stone
* Red Stone
* Blue Stone
* Green Stone
* Athlete Queen
* Moccha Coffee
* Burman Coffee
* Mini-Brahne
* Mayor's Key
* Rank S Medal

The Autograph and Moogle Suit are gotten by witnessing a brief scene with Lowell in Lindblum on Disc 1. A short while later you'll be in Gizamaluke's Grotto and find 4 Gizamaluke Bells - you only need 3 to progress and can keep the 4th in your inventory or use it on the last remaining locked door at any time. Either way it will be visible that you got all 4.

The 4 colored stones are gotten on the Conde Petie Mountain Path on Disc 2 as part of a minor optional side-quest. You can trade them in for a missable and unique Moonstone, or keep them as missable key items. The former lets you have all Moonstone and compete the side-quest, while the latter lets you keep 4 nice key items proving you could have completed it if you had wanted to. It's your choice!

At the start of Disc 3 you'll control Vivi in Alexandria and will have the opportunity to play a racing mini-game against Hippaul. The Athlete Queen is your reward for getting him to Lv 80, and can only be gotten then and there at the beginning of Disc 3.

A few story scenes later you'll have the chance to finally finish the Mr. Morrid's coffee side-quest which you began by picking up the missable Moccha Coffee at South Gate on Disc 1. The Kirman Coffee in Madain Sari cannot be missed permanently, but the other key items in the side-quest, the Burman Coffee, Mini-Brahne and Mayor's Key, are available only on Disc 3 in Dali. As with the colored stones, you can choose to complete the side-quest and get the Mini-Prima-Vista to appear in the Tantalus hideout, or keep the 3 coffees in your inventory forever.

Finally, the Rank S Medal: although it can be gotten on Disc 3 or Disc 4, the condition for this is missable in the sense that you can't reach Rank S if you don't collect enough treasures prior to Disc 4, since all the non-missable ones still available on Disc 4 are not enough to get you the best rank. So you need to collect a certain minimum of the missable treasures as well. This won't be a problem since we'll pick up all of them!

In the end, there is no real reason for not getting any of the key items as they can all be gotten within the limits of this challenge and require no compromises to be made in order to get them.

## Keep your party at Lv 1 in order to achieve max stats later!

Stats actually pose the biggest problem in this perfect game challenge, since in order to obtain perfect stats, you must start working on them from Lv 1. Furthermore, you can only work on them after getting the Excalibur II as you are not only limited by the Lv at which you begin, but also by the available selection of equipment. Simply put, you do not have access to all of the necessary equipment until after you get the Excalibur II, and if it is available, then you either don't have the time to actually get it or to level up with it to a meaningful degree. What does this mean for you? It means that you will be playing the whole game at Lv 1!

If the game lets you, that is. There are many forced battles in the game and most of them can be won without absorbing any EXP by using the Stop spell and the Needle Fork's Add Status property, Petrify. However, there are 3 battles in which EXP is **unavoidable**, namely the battles against Amdusias, Abadon and Shell Dragon in Pandemonium. Depending on what your priorities for your perfect save are, you may have to defeat Tantarian and gain his EXP as well.

Don't be intimidated by a Lv 1 Game; it has its difficult parts, but it's very fun overall!

The issue of the Lv 1 Game and max stats is covered in details in the next two sections of the guide. It's a bit complicated and lengthy, but you have to read and understand it if you want a perfect save which you'll be happy with.

## Deliver and read all missable Mognet letters!

This is a pretty self-explanatory goal. It wouldn't really be a perfect save if you missed any of the letters, especially since you have to deliver them anyway in order to revive Mognet Central on Disc 4.

Reading and receiving all other mail is also a part of this goal. That means you will receive all letters addressed to Zidane and read all the letters from Stiltzkin and other moogles to each other. The point is to have all the letters accessible at the end of the game under the moogles' Mognet menus.

The easiest way to achieve this goal is to simply check the Mognet option every time you meet a moogle, even if it is for the second time in a row. If there is anything to read, receive or deliver you will immediately be prompted to do so. Don't worry, though, as the walkthrough will always mention whether and which letters a moogle has at a particular time, as there are some rare instances when you can miss a letter if you don't purposely backtrack.

Here is a list of all the letters which you must deliver and read during the course of the challenge, in chronological order:

| Deliver | Read |
|:-------:|:----:|
| Kupo &rarr; Monty | Kupo &rarr; Mosh |
| Mois &rarr; Gumo | Ruby &rarr; Zidane |
| Kumop &rarr; Mogki | Stiltzkin &rarr; Monty |
| Mogki &rarr; Atla | Ruby &rarr; Zidane |
| Grimo &rarr; Nazna | Stiltzkin &rarr; Moonte |
| Atla &rarr; Monev | Moodon &rarr; Mogmi |
| Nazna &rarr; Mochos | Stiltzkin &rarr; Mogrich |
| Mopli &rarr; Serino | Ruby &rarr; Zidane |
| Serino &rarr; Moodon | Monev &rarr; Mopli |
| Mosh &rarr; Monty | Kupo &rarr; Mosh |
| Moodon &rarr; Moonte | Stiltzkin &rarr; Monty |
| Kuppo &rarr; Kupo | Ruby &rarr; Zidane |
| Mogmatt &rarr; Suzuna | Kuppo &rarr; Mogki |
| Mogryo &rarr; Mocchi | Stiltzkin &rarr; Mogryo |
| Mogki &rarr; Moodon | Stiltzkin &rarr; Mocchi |
| Mimoza &rarr; Mooel | Mogrika &rarr; Kupo |
| Mojito &rarr; Mogsam | Stiltzkin &rarr; Kupo |
| Mogrika &rarr; Moolan | Kupo &rarr; Mogrich |
| Moolan &rarr; Mogtaka | Artemicion &rarr; Mogrika |
| Mogki &rarr; Kumool | |
| Moorock &rarr; Mozme | |

## Buy all of Stiltzkin's special offers!

This is an easy goal to accomplish. It is also very lucrative, as you can actually make a profit from most of his deals, get several copies of unique items, and even a Ribbon as a reward for buying all the offers. They are all listed below in chronological order, with locations and prices:

| Location | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Price |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Burmecia | Ether | High Potion | Soft | 333 |
| Cleyra | Hi-Potion | Ether | Phoenix Pinion | 444 |
| Fossil Roo | Phoenix Pinion | Remedy | Ether | 555 |
| Mountain Path | Magic Tag | Tent | Ether | 666 |
| Alexandria | Phoenix Pinion | Hi-Potion | Elixir | 777 |
| Oeilvert | Hi-Potion | Emerald | Elixir | 888 |
| Bran Bal | Diamond | Ether | Elixir | 2222 |
| Alexandria | Moonstone | Ruby | Elixir | 5555 |

## Defeat all the Treno weapon shop monsters!

Well, that's all there is to it; defeat Griffin, Catoblepas and Amdusias. You want to be as complete as possible in this challenge and you have to defeat Amdusias anyway as the Running Shoes are given as a reward. Thus, you may as well defeat the other 2 monsters for the sake of competition and some minor benefit (15,000 Gil from Catoblepas).

# The problem of max stats

> Even the best needles are not sharp at both ends.
> 
> *Chinese proverb*

Stats are a gray area in FFIX. The problem is that unlike with unique items or side-quests, stat perfection is rather subjective. Due to the way the stats system is designed, it is impossible to max all stats for any character. The max for Speed (SPD) and Spirit (SPR) is 50, while the max for Strength (STR) and Magic (MAG) is 99.

Everyone is capable of reaching 50 Spirit, but no one achieve the max in the other 3 stats, except Zidane, who can reach 50 Speed. They are all limited by the choice of stat-raising equipment available in the game, which isn't good enough to reach the max in any stat besides Spirit.

##### So the how can you get *max* stats?

Stats, and even individual stat points, are unique in exactly the same way as unique items. The perfect result is therefore not the highest possible to be comprehended by the game, which would be 99 (or 50), but rather the highest attainable in normal gameplay. After that, what is the point of considering 99 to be the maximum amount of Pumice Piece when you can't get any more than 3? It's the same for stats.

##### OK, so let's just reach whatever maximum is possible!

Unfortunately, the real issue here is that it is impossible to achieve all of a character's highest stats **simultaneously**. Simply put, you effectively forfeit points in 1 or more stats in order to raise another; you can **never** raise any stat without neglecting to raise another as much as possible.

For example, using the Robe of Lords will give each stat 1 bonus point, but that means you forfeit giving Magic 2 points with the White Robe, or Spirit 3 with the Dark Gear, and so on, depending on what equipment a character can use. That is why no character can have their highest rating in all stats at once. This in turn means that there is no universal set of highest stats for any character; each player can allocate stat points differently.

Consult [letao's Perfect Stats Guide](https://letao.is-a-geek.net/ff9stats/) for a more in-depth explanation of the mechanics behind the game's stats system, as well as a calculator for finding optimal leveling strategies.

##### Alright, then what are my choices?

There are basically two approaches: **Ordered**, and **Combined**.

**Ordered** paths maximize stats according to the practical importance of each stat to each character, giving priority to the more useful stats. In practice, this means giving each character the maximum 50 SPR, followed by the highest possible STR or MAG (depending on the character) while still getting 50 SPR, then the same for the other one, and finally whatever SPD can still be gotten.

SPR is always maxed out because:

* it's the only stat which can be maxed out for all characters,
* it's the easiest to max,
* it's just as important as STR or MAG, if not more.

SPR determines critical hit rate, Steal rate, Trance gauge fill rate and Trance duration, Thief and Knight Sword damage, probability of Counter activating, the duration of status effects, and more. Note that with 50 SPR and Auto-Regen, your party's HP will fully regenerate even during moderate-length spells or attacks, effectively making your party invincible.

The next stat which is maximized is the character's primary stat. STR is the primary stat for those who tend to use physical attacks or whose moves are based on the STR stat. The opposite is true for MAG. One of these 2 stats always takes third priority, because STR and MAG also influence HP and MP, which everyone needs regardless of their role in battle. Zidane, Steiner, Freya and Amarant are STR-oriented; Vivi, Garnet and Eiko are MAG-oriented. Quina can be either of the two, or balanced (BAL); check his/her description in the [Perfect Stats section](#user-content-perfect-stats) for more information.

Finally, SPD is pretty much ignored completely unless it is gotten for free along with other, superior boosts. Due to the way the ATB system works, SPD does nothing. Only one target can act at any given time and everyone else has to wait until the current animation ends. But ATB time doesn't stop during animations, so even slower characters/enemies usually have enough time to fill their gauges, while the faster ones simply wait with full gauges during the animation. In effect, battles play out in rounds. If your enemy is very slow then you could potentially act twice as often if you used quick physical attacks, but if that's your strategy then just activate Auto-Haste instead of permanently sacrificing other stats for SPD. The existence of Auto-Haste makes SPD pointless, even if the ATB system were different.

There are three different paths within **Ordered**, depending on how you choose to distribute forced EXP: **Path A**, **Path B** and **Path C**.

##### You also mentioned *Combined*?

The **Combined** approach simply maximizes the combined total of all four stats. This lets you get more stat points in total, but their distribution may not be optimal in practical terms. However, since your party can beat everything in the game even at Lv 1, practical terms don't have much of a meaning to begin with, so with this approach you can max stats in a more literal sense.

One thing to note is that each character's max combined stat total can be distributed in various ways without lowering the total. This means that you can still order your combined stats according to the ordered approach, albeit to a very limited extent. Likewise, you could shift the total towards STR for more HP, or MAG for more MP.

##### I don't really like *maxing* stats if they don't hit a cap, thoughâ¦

I feel your pain. Luckily, you've still got two options: **Lv 1**, and **Base**.

In the **Lv 1** path, you let Zidane absorb all the game's forced EXP, allowing you to keep everyone else at Lv 1. You can then either leave Zidane at LV 32, or level him up to Lv 99, using either the **Ordered** or **Combined** approach. Zidane is the only character who is available to take all of the game's unavoidable EXP, so he is the only choice.

The **Base** stats approach is basically the opposite of **Combined**; you go for the minimum stats possible. Unlike max stats, the minimums are clearly defined and you can achieve all of a character's minimum stats simultaneously. All you need to do is avoid gaining Lvs with equipment that boosts SPR, STR, MAG, or SPD. It can boost Defense, Evade, and so on - just not any of the core stats.

This means you can stop playing the low-level game much sooner. Steiner can gain EXP from the very beginning of the game. You don't need to waste over 10 minutes getting the Needle Fork from Zaghnol, and can let Freya take all the EXP from the forced Type A battles once Quina joins the party. You do need to dig up Oak Staff, though, and the other characters must remain at Lv 1 until both Eiko and Amarant join at Lv 1, after which everyone can gain as many Lvs as you like, as long as they never have stat-boosting equipment on when doing so.

Technically, the lowest stats are gotten if characters join at Lv 99, because they do not get the free boosts which are normally awarded upon leveling from EXP. However, only half of your team joins at an average Lv, and it would require leveling almost everyone to Lv 99 before everyone joins. That's not possible during this challenge, and it would lead to very lop-sided stats between the first half of your party, and the other one.


##### What was that about forced/unavoidable EXP?

Yeah, unfortunately it's impossible to completely avoid all EXP and reach Disc 4 with everyone at Lv 1, in prime condition for stat maxing. On the way, you need to get past Amdusias, Abadon, Shell Dragon, as well as Tantarian if you choose to fight him.

There is no way to avoid the EXP from the three Pandemonium battles. Luckily, Freya and Garnet can absorb the EXP from Amdusias and Shell Dragon without any loss to their optimal stats. Abadon is the only problem.

Tantarian also awards EXP which you can't avoid if you fight him. Although you can choose to skip this battle, it's not worth it. Your stats will end up below the max due to Abadon anyway, so skipping Tantarian just means that on top of that you also miss the final copy of the Running Shoes and won't have defeated all optional bosses.

##### So how do you distribute the EXP from Tantarian and Abadon?

Tantarian's EXP is absorbed either by Zidane or Freya, since they always lose fewer points than Vivi and Amarant. Which of the two is chosen depends on the stat path you follow.

Abadon's EXP can be taken by either Zidane or Quina. Steiner is not an option because he would lose considerably more points.

##### What about final/ultimate equipment?

The max stat strategies in this guide assume you remove all equipment from your characters and give them their weakest weapon once finished leveling. This allows you to completely fill up your item list and display your party's natural max stats.

Taking final equipment into account is a problem because most of it gives a boost to SPR. However, SPR can't go above 50, and most stat paths end up with a natural 50 SPR. So if you include final equipment, you would need to re-distribute SPR to another stat if you wanted max stats. But then this locks you into that equipment because if you remove it, your SPR falls below 50 and your stats may no longer be as optimal as they would be if you had a natural 50 SPR after all. So you end up in a kind of catch-22, and it just gets really messy. But if you absolutely insist on including final equipment in your max stat calculations, then consult [letao's guide](http://letao.is-a-geek.net/ff9stats/) for assistance.

You can also consult [monkeyslinger's blog](http://ffixexiipgfinalequip.blogspot.com/), where he details his run through the game following the **Ordered** version with final equipment and BAL Quina.

##### â¦this is getting pretty complicated!

Right - so here's an overview of your 6 choices, each with main ideas, pros, and cons. The stat numbers indicate the effect on the character compared to their theoretical perfect stat set if there were no problems like forced EXP, not having necessary equipment when it's needed, etc.

So: pick your poison :)

---

#### Ordered - Path A: 7 out of 8 characters perfect

Zidane absorbs the EXP from both Tantarian and Abadon.

> Zidane: -1 SPD, -1 STR, -1 MAG

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Party as a whole remains as perfect as possible with *only 1* character sub-optimal<br/>Quina remains flexible, stat orientation can be chosen later<br/>Easy to secure within the 12-hour time limit | Loss of 1 primary stat point<br/>Loss of 2 secondary stat points |

---

#### Ordered - Path B: Net overall stat damage: zero!

Freya absorbs the EXP from Tantarian and Zidane the EXP from Abadon.

> Zidane: +1 SPD, -1 STR, +2 MAG<br/>Freya: -2 MAG

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Net **gain** of 1 secondary stat over perfect sets<br/>Quina remains flexible, stat orientation can be chosen later<br/>Easy to secure within the 12-hour time limit | Loss of 1 primary stat point<br/>2 characters sub-optimal, only 6 of 8 perfect |

---

#### Ordered - Path C: Net primary stat damage: zero!

Freya absorbs the EXP from Tantarian and Quina the EXP from Abadon.

> Freya: -2 MAG<br/>Quina (STR): -1 MAG<br/>Quina (BAL): +1 SPD, -1 MAG

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| No loss to primary stats of any character!<br/>The only **Ordered** path with a perfect Lv 99 Zidane<br/>Most in line with **Ordered** stat priorities | Loss of 2/3 secondary stat points<br/>2 characters sub-optimal, only 6 of 8 perfect<br/>Quina must be either STR or BAL<br/>STR Quina version very hard during the challenge<br/>BAL Quina version even harder |

###### Notes

The stat differences for Quina refer to two different totals: the STR Quina loses 1 MAG compared to the perfect STR Quina, and the BAL Quina loses 1 MAG but gains 1 SPD compared to perfect BAL Quina.

---

#### Combined stats: The highest overall stats - period

Freya absorbs the EXP from Tantarian, Abadon is harmless.

> Freya: -2 STR, +1 MAG

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| *Stat maxing* by definition, pure and simple<br/>Just 1 point away from the absolute highest stat total<br/>Party as perfect as possible with *only 1* character sub-optimal | By far the most difficult version of the challenge<br/>No really, it's extremely hard and very tedious |

---

#### Lv 1 Path: Elite Lv 1 Novelty!

Zidane absorbs all of the game's forced EXP.

> **Ordered**: -2 STR, +3 MAG<br/>**Combined**: -1 SPD, -2 STR

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| 7 out of 8 characters in pristine Lv 1 condition<br/>Zidane heroically takes the hit for everyone else :)<br/>Easy to secure within the 12-hour time limit | Party will be kind of lob-sided - then again, Zidane is the lead<br/>Lvs not maxed out, something left unfinished in your save file |

###### Notes

As with Quina in **Path C**, these stat changes refer to different totals: perfect **Ordered** and perfect **Combined** stats, respectively.

---

#### Base stats: 100% perfectly minimal

You laugh at the face of forced EXP!

> No impact on stats

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| The only path which actually meets its criteria 100%<br/>The easiest version of the challenge, by far | Requires a radical redefinition of perfection<br/>Stats could still be lower theoretically |

---

##### Can I choose later?

It's possible to put off the decision until you reach Tantarian at the start of Disc 3. Keep in mind that **Path C** and **Combined** are very tight when it comes to the target times, so if you want to keep those options open, then you'll need to play very aggressively up to that point. That would end up being a waste of effort if you decide to take one of the other paths, which allow for more slack in game time.

So the option of delaying the decision is there, but it's in your interest to settle on a stat path from the start.

##### How are these 6 paths handled in a single playthrough?

The target times and walkthrough are based on **Path A**, **Path B** and **Lv 1**. They form the basis of the playthrough. **Path C** and **Combined** need to complete some extra tasks on top of this, and these detours are outlined in path-specific boxes. They include the extra time needed and extra Gil spent, when applicable.

There are practically no difference until the beginning of Disc 3, and about 95% of the instructions and strategies are uniform across all stat paths. The major branching points are Tantarian and Pandemonium, but the instructions before and after these points are still mostly the same for everyone. What you should keep in mind is that there is no need to finish the challenge with time to spare. As long as you make it to the end within 12 hours, you're fine. Therefore, feel free to take off some of the time pressure on difficult segments by using some of the extra buffer time. How much extra time there is depends on which stat path you will follow:

| Stat path | Detour time | Buffer time |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Path A**, **Path B**, **Lv 1** | 00:00 | 46:53 |
| **Path C** | 14:45 | 32:08 |
| **Combined** | 39:45 | 7:08 |

So basically, if you're not playing **Path C** or **Combined**, then you can relax and just consider the target times a very fuzzy rule of thumb. If you're playing **Path C**, then you shouldn't have too many problems either, but be aware that 30 minutes can be used up very quickly if you're not careful. If playing **Combined**, don't use your buffer unless you absolutely have to, and try to keep it as long as possible &ndash; 7 minutes really won't get you that far.

# Using this guide

There are a few things you should keep in mind throughout the challenge and which aren't pointed out again and again in the walkthrough &ndash; as follows:

## Skip all dialogues!

Skip **all** dialogues by alternately mashing the **X** and **square** buttons. Using both buttons significantly increases the speed of running through text as opposed to using only one. Just try to start with the X button when speaking to NPCs so that you don't initiate a card battle, and read through the text normally on practice runs to acquaint yourself with the timing of important prompts asking for a decision.

## Skip all ATEs!

Skip **all** ATEs unless instructed to do otherwise. Some ATEs are not skippable.

Provided you powerplay during the entire challenge, it is actually possible to also watch all of the game's ATEs. However, it won't be possible for all stat paths, and you may need to skip the 10th Promist Ring. Also, keep in mind that it's not actually possible to watch every single ATE in a single playthrough since some of them are forks leading to other ATEs but also locking you out of others at the same time.

## Skip all FMVs!

Yup, more skipping! As with ATEs, it's also possible to complete the challenge without skipping any of the FMVs &ndash; they *only* take 35 minutes so it's not even that difficult, provided you make some sacrifices or powerplay. It's even possible to combine this with watching all the ATEs, but you'd need to skip other more tangible parts of the perfect save. In any case, though, I don't think it's worth it and would recommend just skipping them.

##### Ok, but how do I skip them?

| Platform | Method |
|----------|--------|
| PS1 | Opening and closing the disc cover will do the trick. But you should get a PS2 to take advantage of the much faster load times, which add up very quickly (more on this below). |
| PS2 | Press the eject button, and then press it again the moment you hear the disc tray moving out. You don't need to wait for it to come all the way out, it's the signal to the laser that matters. |
| PS2 Slim | Once the FMV starts to play, open the lid and close it again once the disc has stopped spinning.<br/>Listen to the sound the laser makes, and open/close the lid again after hearing the second set of sounds. This may differ between slim models so experiment to find the right moment.<br/>If you can't get it to work, you can replace your disk with another one after opening for the first time.<br/>Wait for the laser to begin reading the new disc, then open the lid again and put back the proper FFIX disc.<br/>Close the lid and wait for the game to resume. |
| PS3 | As far as I know, it is not possible to skip FMVs on the PS3. I don't have one myself, but I have been told that neither the physical disc version nor the PSN version can be forced to skip the FMV. |
| Emulator | Once the FMV starts to play, press Esc, then File > Change Disc > ISO.<br/>Select another disc ISO or just a blank text document, and click OK.<br/>The moment the game loads back up, immediately press Esc and change back to the correct disc. You need to be quick, otherwise the game will hang. |

##### Hum, there's quite a delay after skipping FMVsâ¦

You should employ the so-called **pause trick** to reduce the amount of time you lose through FMVs even further, explanation courtesy of Louis1980:

> First, I've noticed that the time you might save before the FMV is minimal at best (like almost always < 1s), so I overlook it. After the FMV, on the other hand, can save up to 10-12s. What I do is this (for PS2):
> 
> I open and close the disc tray. When the disc tray is closed, I start holding down the **start** button **before** the game finishes skipping the FMV (i.e. before the screen gets black). The game always pauses for me right after the screen goes black, then I release the **start** button. After about 10s, un-pause, and the game resumes with no delay. Never fails.

## Optimize your system settings!

The PS2 is the best console to use for this challenge. The reason? Faster load times. And yes, it makes a **huge** difference over the course of 12 hours and hundreds of screens. The PS2's PlayStation Driver has a Fast Disc Speed mode which you should always activate.

In order to activate this mode, turn on the PS2 without a disc in the disc tray. Press **triangle** on the screen with the *Browser* and *System Configuration* options to display your PS2's Version Information screen. Here, highlight *PlayStation Driver* and press **triangle** again. You will be shown the PlayStation Driver's Options screen. Set *Disc Speed* to *Fast*. While you're there, you may as well set *Texture Mapping* to *Smooth* to improve the game's graphics. Back out these screens, insert the proper FFIX disc and play as usual.

Soft resets will thankfully not reset the PlayStation Driver's setting, but a *hard* reset (i.e. pressing the **reset** button or turning the system on and off) will. This means you need to repeat this procedure every time you begin a new session of play. But it's very much worth it, so do make use of this excellent feature if you're playing on a PS2 (which you should be!).

## Manage your saves wisely!

Try to have 1 memory card devoted to this challenge; you should have at least 5 back-up saves because there's always the risk that you forget or miss something important, or want to go back to improve a certain part of the game. It happens to the best of us. 

I use two blank memory cards. If you only have 1 memory card, I suggest you fill up the memory card with saves until there is no more room. Then, if you have a PS2, copy all the files onto your PS2 memory card and clear the PS1 card. Now you have another 15 save files! If you ever want to return to a previous save, you have to copy it onto the PS1 card before you can load it. Unfortunately, you need another PS2 memory card for the next 15 FFIX saves, so you will need to rationalize the selection of saves at some point.

Also, try not to save on a single file more than once, especially when doing longer and more difficult circuits. This will save you real-life time in the long run as you won't suddenly find yourself having to redo an hour or more of game-time if you make an error and save it.

Finally, if any more reasoning is needed, then saving on a blank slot is a second or two faster :)

## Learn to abuse, erm, take advantage of the battle system!

Playing the game at Lv 1 requires you to use every trick up your sleeve just to survive. Learning to abuse the **Wait ATB** mode is of particular importance.

The **Wait ATB** mode allows you to stop ATB time by entering a menu. This is very useful when checking whether a spell has succeeded, whether your characters have managed to knock themselves out, or when your next actions are determined by the effects of an enemy's or party member's attack. The idea is to reduce the amount of ATB time between your characters' actions, thus minimizing the number of turns the enemy gets, and making it easier to carry out your battle strategies coherently.

Opening then menu at the right time can literally mean the difference between a victory and a defeat. By not opening the menu, you are letting actions play out in real time. If your other character(s) are only waiting to see the effects of an attack before doing something themselves, it is in your interest to open a menu. The action in question will still play out, but you won't allow your enemy's ATB gauge to fill in the meantime, which could result in an enemy getting a turn between those of your party members. This lets you use all your turns to the fullest, thus optimizing your performance both in terms of the chance of success and the speed of victory.

## Practice, practice, practice!

It should go without saying that if you're going for a perfect save, you'll need to perfect the individual runs that get you there.

Play and reach each section once or twice before attempting it seriously; you need to acquaint yourself with treasure locations, shop lists, menu operations and the overall route through each area. Read a circuit or two ahead so you have an idea of what you will be preparing for and what is waiting for you.

Also don't let the clock stress you too much. Use the **pause** button to your advantage; pausing the game also stops the timer, so use this when you need a break, or need to remember or think about what to do next, especially during battles. If something unexpected happens, just press **pause** and analyze the situation.

Finally, it's crucial that you have the minimum amount of enemy encounters possible; try to follow the guidelines provided in the walkthrough. In no case should you ever settle for having more than 1 extra battle in a given segment. A random battle wastes at least 30-40 seconds, which quickly adds up if you let it get out of hand. Flee from all battles unless instructed to do otherwise, and keep L1 and R1 pressed at all times during a battle in hopes of running away sooner.

And no, the *stop/run* method has been debunked and does **not** work.

## Patience, patience, patience!

RNG > you, basically. Learn to accept it.

This guide aims to maximize your odds of success, whether it be with battle strategies, time-saving detours, tricks, or whatever else. That said, many aspects still revolve around pure luck, and you need to accept that. Some parts simply require patience and perseverance until they work. If something isn't going your way, then take a break and do something else. You'll often get it within your first few tries when you return.

> Every time you find yourself willing to settle is usually the best time to get up and do something else!

## Master the art of the soft reset!

**L1 + L2 + R1 + R2 + start + select: the solution to every problem ^__^**

The walkthrough is divided in many smaller segments, covering all the actions from one major save point to the next. Each section begins with the items to be collected during that part, followed by the instructions in bullet-point format, and ends with the suggested target time and target Gil which you should have at that point, as well as the number of random battles allowed during that section (mostly 0).

Important AP gains and suggested progress on specific abilities are listed together with the battles in which you get the AP, mostly boss battles. Keep in mind that these are minimum; you may have more AP for some abilities if following one stat path as opposed to another, but as long as you have the minimum, you're good. You might also learn other abilities without it being mentioned - that's fine as well. Only the crucial abilities are tracked.

A large part of the walkthrough (up to Disc 3) is uniform for all possible stat paths, but from Disc 3 onwards there will be several forks in the road depending on which part you'll be following. Path specific instructions are given in separate information boxes, along with the estimated time and Gil changes due to the respective detour. If these detours apply to your game, then you need to apply the time and Gil changes to the target ones. Otherwise ignore everything in these boxes.

Here's a sample section:

# Video assistance

A number of very skilled players have recorded their runs for your viewing pleasure! If you'd like to see what this challenge is really like, or need to see how some parts should be done in practice, check out the playlists below. All of them cover the complete game from start to finish, so you can watch any section you're interested in. They're the official supplements to this guide :)

Please note that the guide has changed several times since each of these runs were posted. This means that some parts may vary considerably. They are listed from newest to oldest. Nonetheless, the videos are still useful, and at the very least serve as quite a nice historical account of how this guide and challenge have developed and been refined over the years.

Keep in mind that all of these runs were done at an expert level, and they only show the most successful attempts; some of these videos took many hours of resetting to get just right. So don't expect to jump in and *simply do the same thing* right away.

Also, most of them finish the challenge with a ton of time to spare. Unless you're looking to challenge yourself even more or break some sort of record, reaching the Excalibur II any earlier than 11:59:59 is completely unnecessary. It makes for exciting viewing and is a cool achievement, but if all you want is just to get a perfect save, then there's no reason to complete anything faster than you need to.

#### Battle: Masked Man (0 AP)

* Have everyone Steal once; reset if you don't get the Mage Masher.
* Its rarity is 16/256, so it shouldn't take too many attempts to get it within the first round.
* Once you get the Mage Masher, simply have everyone attack themselves to end the battle; you won't get a Game Over.

---

* Reply that you are kidnapping Princess Garnet; it takes 3 extra minutes to trigger the secret scene with Ruby and it's just regular dialogue. But if you feel like you really need to do it then go ahead &ndash; it won't prevent you from completing the challenge.
<br/>

* As Vivi, search the house to the right, then head up the street.
* Search the item shop, but skip the pub; you'll search it on Disc 3.
* When you arrive at the square, head right and search the shops; do not approach the ticket booth just yet. Also, don't forget the Phoenix Pinion to the left of the main gate.
* Leave the square by way of the bottom left exit and head towards the docks; enter the house **only** if you see a girl run **out** of it, otherwise keep going. There are 2 treasures in this house, but you can pick them up on Disc 3.
<br/>

* Speak with the boy behind the steeple, reply *Yes* and head all the way back to where you first gained control of Vivi.
* Head down, search the square and speak to the cat near the bottom of the screen.
* Now go to the ticket booth and show the ticket master your ticket.
* Then, enter the alley once again and choose the first answer to every question asked.
* Speak to Tom behind the steeple to claim your reward for finding the cat, a Bomb Card.
<br/>

* Follow the Rat Boy into the steeple, search it and attempt to climb the ladder.
* Pick up Kupo's letter for delivery and save your game.

> #### King of Jump Rope and Kupo's letter
> 
> * You can miss a Mognet letter depending on your actions in Alexandria. The letter in question is the one Mosh receives from Kupo, about the Jump Rope mini-game. The letter specifically mentions your exact jump rope record, with the minimum required number of jumps being 50.
> * However, this letter is not visible on Disc 4 because Mosh is then found in Mognet Central telling you how many letters you delivered; his dialogue doesn't let you view any letters he may have received in the past. This letter also does not count in the total quoted by Mosh because only letters delivered by Zidane are taken into account. 
> * If you don't care about missing a letter which won't be viewable on Disc 4, then you can just move on. However, if you care about getting truly every single Mognet letter, then you'll need to get this one as well. You have some choices:
> * You'll eventually have to complete the Jump Rope mini-game anyway and jump 1,000 times in order to obtain the King of Jump Rope key item. You can do so on the first try to have a clean record with 1,000 as the first and only entry. The entries are only visible after 3 attempts, but it's possible to show that you got 1,000 on the first try by just playing 2 more games. In this case, getting the letter with anything less than 1,000 jumps would mess up your ranking, so you'd need to jump 1,000 times now on Disc 1.
> * On the other hand, you can also go for a ranking screen with 3 1,000's, in which case getter the letter in any form would be fine since the lower score would be removed from the ranking screen anyway. However, the lowest score will remain quoted in the letter and would be visible on Disc 4 if you could somehow access Mosh's Mognet menu.
> * Jumping the requisite minimum of 50 times takes an extra 90 seconds from loading your save and saving again once finished. For 1,000 jumps, this comes to exactly 8 minutes.

* Climb the ladder and follow Rat Boy over the rooftops; don't forget to search all the bird nests for Gil.
* You don't need to press any buttons during the play - the dialogue advances automatically.

---

#### Battle: King Leo, Benero, Zenero (0 AP)

* Attack Benero and Zenero once each with anyone except Cinna in order to minimize the amount of fake magic animations you have to watch.
* If they attack with magic before your ATB is full, then don't bother with them and begin attacking King Leo, since they will most likely switch to quick physical attacks for the next round anyway.
* Attack King Leo 5 to 6 times to end the battle.
* Unfortunately, knocking everyone out won't work this time (it would be contrary to the play's plot!)

---

> #### Impressing all 100 nobles
> 
> * You need to do this for the missable and unique Moonstone which you are later given as a reward. The 10,000 Gil also comes in **very** handy.
> * There are 49 commands total, and you have to input them all correctly and quickly to impress all 100 nobles (2 pts per input, 1 pt bonus for getting them all right, and 1 freebie - credits: NBtheGameMaster)
> * Here are some tips:
>     - Turn off the volume of your TV.
>     - Concentrate on accuracy rather than speed. If you make a mistake, then you won't impress 100 nobles no matter how fast you pressed all the other commands. That said, you do need to be swift too.
>     - Even though it might seem like they follow a pattern, don't anticipate any of the buttons showing up; take it one at a time.
>     - You can try covering the TV so that you only see the prompts.
>  * Each attempt takes exactly 1 minute regardless of how you do, so reset if you've lost too much time.
>  * **Do not mash the X button when a sequence finishes!** The default option is to do the scene over, and you don't want that when you finally impress all 100 nobles and Queen Brahne!

* Breathe a sigh of relief once you're done; this can be one of the hardest parts of this challenge.
<br/>
* When you encounter Garnet on the stairs, choose whatever option you want.
* As Steiner, run up the stairs, through the lower exit and speak to Queen Brahne to claim your well-deserved Moonstone.
* Run down the stairs, to the right and save your game with Mosh the moogle.

* Pick up the Phoenix Down near the door and exit the room; you don't need to speak to either of the guards since Steiner already reprimanded them.
* Enter the door under the walkway and catch the Pluto Knight running on the balcony.
* Enter the right chamber on the second floor and speak with the Pluto Knight.
* Go back and down the stairs to the first floor, and then enter the left room to find yet another Pluto Knight.
* Exit the library and leave the castle.
* Talk to the Pluto Knight by the water then head left and talk to the Pluto Knight by the tower entrance.
* *Optional*: Head right and talk to the disguised Marcus. He doesn't count towards the total, but Steiner will make a comment about there having been an extra knight in his count when getting the Elixir.
* Enter and climb the tower.
* Speak with the final Pluto Knight on the stairway to receive an Elixir, then continue to the top of the tower.

* Optimize Zidane and follow the princess.
* Once in the boiler room, turn the lever both ways to make 2 treasure chests fall from the ceiling; open them and go through the door.

* *2nd fight*: Steal the 256/256 Broadsword, then just keep attacking.

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Zidane | Protect Girls | 3/35 |

---

* Every screen in the Prima Vista has some treasure in it, so search all of them carefully.
* Go down the stairs and into the room on the right.
* Speak with Vivi, leave the room and choose to go look for Garnet. Choosing the other option initiates an extra scene, but it takes an extra minute and has no special effect, so I suggest skipping it.
* Now head left, down the stairs and through the bottom exit; pick up the Leather Hat and return to the previous room.
* Go through the right door, then backtrack and speak to Baku to initiate the duel.

---

#### Battle: Baku (0 AP)

* With the Mage Masher equipped, just attack 3 times and you'll win.

---

* Now go to Steiner's room (don't forget to search it afterwards) and then to Vivi's room.
* Exit the Prima Vista and save your game; there's also a letter from Ruby.
<br/>
* Make your way through the forest until you reach the spring.
* Deliver Kupo's letter to Monty, read the letter Monty received from Stiltzkin and save your game.

### Evil Forest &rarr; Gunitas Basin

* Head deeper into the forest to find Garnet.

#### Battle: Plant Brain (5 AP)

* Have Zidane knock himself out to make Blank appear an push the fight into the second and final phase.
* Vivi and Steiner should have full or nearly full ATB gauge by the time Blank shows up, so use Fire, Fire Sword and Blank's physical attack all at once to finish the battle in a single round.
* If you're very lucky, Plant Brain may not even get a single turn.
* Don't waste your time stealing anything; it's not worth it.

---

* Unequip Blank and replace his Iron Sword with a Broadsword, then continue onward.

---

#### Battle: Plant Spider x2 (1 AP)

* If there are more than 2 Plan Spiders, **reset the game** and try again.
* Use a spread Fire spell or two physical attacks to win the battle; make sure everyone survives to keep your party at Lv 1.
* Do **not** have Blank absorb all the EXP, as that will make Amarant join the party at Lv 3. You have been warned.

---

> #### Base stats
> 
> You can let Steiner absorb all of the forced EXP here, regardless of how many Plant Spiders appear.

* Skip the tutorial by choosing *Nothing*.
* On the World Map, head south while the nameplate is displayed to avoid random battles and enter Ice Cavern.

* This is a pretty straightforward area, just search every screen.
* Never make contact with the white wind as touching it instantly throws you into a random battle. Wait for it to die down or turn dark; that's when it's safe to pass through.
* Although it's still not exactly easy, you can make it through the entire area without any encounters by changing screens a bit more often than otherwise necessary - changing screens resets the encounter check.
<br/>
* On the screen with the Potion and the Ether, pick up only one per trip, backtracking to the previous screen after getting each, and then getting past the screen on a third try. You may want to start with the Potion since it's the harder to grab without a battle.
* On the screen after that, get both of the chests on the right, then move on to the next area and immediately backtrack to defrost the wall and loot the third chest.
* In the final area, grab the Phoenix Down, and continue onward.
* Head left at the fork, defrost Mois the moogle, skip the tutorial, accept the letter from Gumo, and finally save.

* Now backtrack to the previous area, defrost the wall, and pick up the Leather Wrist in the chest at the end of the tunnel.

#### Battle: Black Waltz #1 & Sealion (5 AP)

* Alternate between attacking Black Waltz #1 and using a Potion.
* Once Black Waltz #1 is defeated, begin stealing from Sealion.
* Use a Potion when needed and wait for the Trance gauge to fill.
* Reset if you don't steal the Mythril Dagger; if you steal it and have extra turns left, make sure you get his Ether as well.
* Once Zidane reaches Trance, use a physical attack followed by Tidal Flame to end the battle.

* Say goodbye to Ice Cavern and run across Nolrich Heights to enter Dali.

* Leave the inn, head upwards and right to enter a farm plot, then go back to enter and exit the pub, and then enter and exit the windmill.

* After the scenes, head back to where you spoke with Vivi earlier, and then enter the windmill and go down the hatch.
* Make your way through the screens until you reunite with Vivi, picking up all of the items except the Iron Helm, which you should grab on the way back to the barrel with Kumop. Find  Kumop in the barrel, take his letter to Mogki and save your game.

* Proceed onward, then examine and choose to open the large door; run from the resulting battle with Flee or, if you're lucky, L1 + R1 escape. Since the save point is so close, I would reset if you get stuck watching too many spell animations before running away.
* Open all 3 chests in the Mist room, then continue to the end of the area. 
* Optimize Zidane and Vivi and activate Zidane's Bandit ability.
* Don't bother healing or reviving anyone as you will be fully healed prior to the upcoming boss fight.
<br/>
* Steiner should be equipped with the Iron Sword, Bronze Helm, Bronze Glove and Bronze Armor, with the Bird Killer ability activated; if not, make the necessary adjustments now.
* Head down the mountain, pick up both treasures at the base, enter Morrid's house and stand still; this often makes him come inside immediately.
* Talk to Morrid, then leave Observatory Mountain.
* Choose the second option when examining the barrel.

#### Battle: Black Waltz #2 (5 AP)

* Don't enter any command until Black Waltz #2 makes his first move.
* Make both Steiner and Zidane attack (Fire Sword if Vivi survives the boss's first attack), and keep Vivi and Garnet on stand-by. Don't heal any damage yet.
* Wait for Black Waltz #2's second attack to connect, then have Vivi attack whoever was targeted by this move. If it was him and he was knocked out then the boss did this step for you.
* Next, make Steiner and Zidane attack again.
* Finally, have Garnet throw a potion on Steiner or Zidane if they're no longer at full HP.
* Black Waltz #2 Fira counter should be neutralized and so his third attack will now be another single-target one.
* Have Steiner and Zidane attack to win the battle; you can use Fire Sword if Vivi hasn't been knocked out.
* If you didn't Steal an Ether from Sealion, then make sure Black Waltz #2 drops 2 of them.

---

* Choose to depart immediately after Garnet corrects her speech.
* On the airship, climb the ladder in the back of the engine room and head into the cockpit.

---

#### Battle: Black Waltz #3 (0 AP)

* This battle is very easy because it always follows the same pattern.
* For the first round, have Zidane attack, Steiner use Fire Sword and Vivi cast Fire x2.
* For the second round, let Zidane Steal once, then use Fire Sword and Fire x2 again to win the battle.

---

* In Lindblum, remove everyone's equipment before boarding the lift with Minister Artania.
* Once you regain control of Zidane at the inn, skip the last tutorial, enter the neighboring room and read the letter from Ruby; save your game.

* Go upwards to the market square, search the left street area and the house between the two streets.
* Head down the right alley and enter Dragoos' Weapon Shop. Auto-arrange your inventory if you like.
<br/>
* You will need a minimum of 15,120 Gil to make the following purchases. You should be able to make at least the following transactions:

| Items sold | Quantity | Gil | Items bought | Quantity | Gil |
|------------|:--------:|----:|--------------|:--------:|----:|

**The cotton robe trick!**

* You can basically sell all copies of the above items, except for Tent. If you're planning to have Zidane win the Festival of the Hunt (read the next section for a detailed explanation), then you should leave at least 1 Tent in your inventory, preferably 2. If you plan to have Freya win then you can just sell all your Tent.

* Pick up all the treasures in the hideout, then head down the stairs outside.
* Speak with the crowd, then follow the *moogle* to Artist Michael's study.
* Take the Moogle Suit, the Autograph and the Ore, then take an aircab to Lindblum Castle.
* Enter the guest room, speak with Steiner and then attempt to take the lift.
* Speak to the sleeping guard outside the guest room, then take the lift and find Garnet at the overlook.
* Find all 6 areas with the telescope.
* Back in the guest room, open both chests, deliver Kumop's letter, take the letter from Atla and save your game.

> #### The Festival of the Hunt
> 
> * There are two issues to consider with the Festival of the Hunt; who wins and with how many points. This may be important to you because it is visible on Disc 4 by checking the letter Mogmi in Gizamaluke's Grotto receives from Moodon. Here's an overview of your choices:
> 
> | Character winning | Pros | Cons |
> |-------------------|------|------|
> | Zidane | Fits the plot very nicely<br/>Can engineer number of points | Takes about 2:40 extra |
> | Freya | Saves about 2:40 | Random number of points |
> | Vivi | Saves about 2:40 | Random number of points |
> 
> * Who wins is really just a personal choice. The rewards make little difference; the 5,000 Gil is nice but not essential, and the Coral Ring is useful, but can be synthesized soon enough anyway. The Theater Ship Card is of course completely worthless. Likewise, the 3 minutes you save or lose in nothing permanent or game-changing either. So I would recommend deciding based on who you prefer to win or whether you care about the number of points they win with.
> * As for the amount of points, you have little control over this since the points received are random. 303 points is the maximum score, 100 points is the minimum for the letter to be written and delivered.
> * It's difficult to get a specific value for anyone except Zidane. If you let Zidane win, then you can use the tables below to engineer the number of points he gets. You can get a very wide range of values and it's easy to get anything around 250; for higher values you'll need a bit of luck with Zaghnol. Just don't aim for the maximum - you would be more likely to win the lottery.
> 
> | Monster | Area | Location | Points |
> |---------|------|----------|:------:|
> | Mu | Theater District | outside the station | 10-12 |
> | Trick Sparrow | Theater District | outside the station | 1-3 |
> | Trick Sparrow | Theater District | outside the hideout | 10-12 |
> | Fang | Theater District | by the theater | 19-21 |
> | Fang | Industrial District | chasing a cat | 19-21 |
> | Mu | Industrial District | running down the stairs | 10-12 |
> | Mu | Industrial District | hiding in the pub | 10-12 |
> | Mu | Industrial District | end of the street | 7-9 |
> | Trick Sparrow | Business District | outside the station | 13-15 |
> | Mu | Business District | running out of a house | 13-15 |
> | Fang | Business District | left area of the market | 16-18 |
> | Fang | Business District | outside the church | 19-21 |
> | Trick Sparrow | Business District | on church doorstep | 4-6 |
> | Fang | Business District | chasing Vivi | 25-27 |
> | Zaghnol | Business District | by the fountain | 50-99 |
> 
> * In order for Zidane to win the festival, he must be in first place when the timer runs out. Freya wins by default if Zidane is knocked out, but since you need the Needle Fork to advance the challenge, you will have to have Freya deal the finishing blow against Zaghnol with Zidane knocked out to have her win. Vivi is the winner if both Zidane and Freya are knocked out during the battle against Zaghnol.
> * This guide assumes you let Zidane win. It is the only option which allows you to engineer the amount of points you get. The max score of 303 would require getting the best score on every single monster, which is practically impossible. However, the minimum, which happens to be a nice, round 100, is easily attainable and isn't as arbitrary. Having Zidane win the festival also fits the storyline rather well, I think, and the 5,000 Gil certainly doesn't hurt.
> * Should you choose to let either Freya or Vivi be the winner of the festival, then you'll simply gain a nice 3-minute lead on the target times at this point. The amount of points they win with is completely random and usually ranges from 50 to 150 from my experience.
> 
> **Time**: +3:00

<br/>

> #### Base stats
> 
> * There is no need to fight Zaghnol for the Needle Fork since you can have Freya absorb the upcoming EXP once Quina is in the party.

* Head straight for the aircab dock - you'll have plenty of time for all other preparations once the festival timer starts.
* Equip Zidane with The Ogre, Steepled Hat, Leather Wrist, Bronze Vest and Yellow Scarf; activate his Beast Killer ability; put him in the back row.
* If you want Zidane or Vivi to win, then just wait in the Business District shopping area to fight Zaghnol.
<br/>
* Avoid the Trick Sparrow outside the station by hugging the right side of the screen (the Mu only appears after battling the Trick Sparrow so don't worry about it). Doing this also leaves you with the most possible options for monsters to fight after Zaghnol if you want a specific number of points for Zidane.
<br/>
* If you want Freya to be the victor, then engage one of the Fangs in the Business District. Either the one standing on the left or the one chasing Vivi will do.
* Simply have Zidane remain idle and get beat up by the Fang to fill up his Trance gauge. Use a Potion whenever needed and knock out the Fang once you're 1 or 2 hits away from reaching Trance.
* Wait until the clock reads 4:30 or less, then go to the square to fightâ¦

#### Battle: Zaghnol (0 AP)

**Zidane**

* Have Zidane and Freya throw a Tent until it connects.
* Then make Freya Jump each round and Zidane Steal. Use a Potion if Heave connects and have Zidane begin attacking once you've stolen the Needle Fork.
* Zaghnol has 1,574 HP; keep track of it with a calculator and make sure Zidane deals the finishing blow.

**Freya**

* Make Zidane Steal and keep Freya on stand-by to administer Potion.
* You will most likely need to get the Needle Fork within two attempts.
* Zidane should enter Trance within 1 or 2 attacks from Zaghnol; once he does and you have the Needle Fork, simply use Shift Break and have Freya Jump to end the battle with her dealing the finishing blow.

**Vivi**

* Have Zidane Steal until he grabs the Needle Fork and keep Freya on stand-by to administer Potion or Phoenix Down if needed.
* Knock out both of them once you have the Needle Fork.

---

* If you want Zidane to win then after the battle you will still have the time left on the clock to seek out the necessary monster(s) for any remaining points. If you want to get 100 then it should be possible for almost all values awarded for Zaghnol; check the tables.
* Don't forget to heal Zidane and equip The Ogre.
* Some luck is involved as you never have more than a 1 out of 3 chance of getting the desired value, but these are rather good odds compared to some other things in this challenge.
<br/>
* After the scenes, take the lift to the base level station, ride to and open the chest at the Serpent's Gate and then ride straight to the Dragon's Gate.
* Read the letter Moodon received from Stiltzkin, then save your game.

* Pick up the Tent behind the platform, then head out into the Mist.

* Cross the wetlands to Qu's Marsh, head to the pond and catch a frog for Quina (the huge one in the top right corner of the marsh is easy to catch).

> #### Base stats
> 
> * You can let Freya absorb any EXP you might come across once Quina has joined the party. (Hint: Type A x 2)

* Equip your party as follow:

| Vivi | Zidane | Freya | Quina |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| Mage Staff<br/>Steepled Hat<br/>Leather Wrist<br/>Cotton Robe<br/>Yellow Scarf | Mythril Dagger<br/>Steepled Hat<br/>Glass Armlet<br/>Leather Plate<br/>Yellow Scarf | Javelin<br/>Iron Helm<br/>Bronze Gloves<br/>Linen Cuirass<br/>Yellow Scarf | Needle Fork<br/>Feather Hat<br/>Leather Wrist<br/>Bronze Vest<br/>Yellow Scarf |
| | | | Add Status<br/>Millionaire |

* Make sure only Zidane and Freya are in the front row.
* Leave Qu's Marsh by way of the right path to avoid the frog-catching mini-game and head to Gizamaluke's Grotto.
* Enter, pick up the first Gizamaluke Bell, then exit and save right outside the entrance.

**Target time**: 02:12:37

* Now enter the main cavern to initiate your first and worst forced EXP encounter :)

---

#### Battle: Type A x 2 (2 AP)

* The goal is to Petrify both Type A's with the Needle Fork.
* Ideally, you would Petrify them both with only 2 hits total, but the probability if this is only 1%. A more reasonable target would be to Petrify both within 4 or less hits - that's a 5% (1/20) chance.
* Have Quina attack non-stop and everyone else Defend, only using a Potion on themselves or Quina if they get low on HP.
* Keep in mind that the Type A's have 398 HP, so you may need to heal them as well, although chances are the battle will already have dragged on a bit too long if it comes to that.

* After the battle, backtrack out of the grotto once again and head east to the Chocobo's Forest.
* Save a few steps outside the grotto.

**Target time**: 02:15:28

* Enter Chocobo's Forest, then exit, call Choco, and return to play a game of Chocobo Hot&Cold.

> #### Chocobo Hot&Cold
> 
> * If you don't unearth the *Stone with Patterns* during your first game, reset and try again.
> * The *Stone with Patterns* will always be the *Streamside* Chocograph, so don't bother replaying in hopes of getting anything else. Once you have it, leave and save the game.
> 
> * Now play another game of Hot&Cold. Reset until you find a Chocograph.
> * When you do, exit and ride to South Gate; grab the two items, then leave and save your game on another save file.
> * Check which Chocograph you got. You'll need both *Healing Shore* and *Small Beach*, so reload the earlier save if you didn't get either.
> 
> * Return and play 1 more game in hopes of getting the other Chocograph!
> * Be sure to purchase Gysahl Greens before leaving so that you have at least 6 in your inventory.
> * Equip Zidane with the Mage Masher and use Phoenix Down if needed.
> * Save your game near the forest by the river.

<br/>

> #### Path C & Combined
> 
> * You will need to collect all 6 Chocograph Pieces during the challenge and the first is already available.
> * You can't unearth it during the very first game with the *Stone with Patterns*, but it's possible to find it in a single game with other Chocographs.
> * I recommend you try to dig up the Chocograph Piece during the second game - it's relatively rare to find both in a single game and then you still have the issue of getting one of the *right* Chocographs. By doing it you still have 2 Chocographs to get, you double your odds of getting one of the *right* Chocographs with the Chocograph Piece.

**Target time**: 02:22:55

* Head to the wild forest near the river and encounter a group of Mandragora.
* Choose 1 Mandragora and have Vivi use Fire, Freya attack physically, and Quina use Eat to learn the almighty Limit Glove :)
* Alternatively, have Zidane and Freya attack and Quina use Eat. This method also works if you get a pre-emptive strike!
* Once you've done this, make either Vivi or Freya attack Quina to knock him/her out and then have Zidane use Flee to escape the battle without EXP.
* Mount Choco and ride back to Gizamaluke's Grotto; place everyone in the back row and save your game outside.

* Re-enter Gizamaluke's Grotto and check the soldier's body for another Gizamaluke's Bell.
* Go to the main chamber and run straight for the steps; you should be able to evade the Black Mage in that area by heading for the left railing and then quickly onto the steps. There isn't much strategy to this, just practice a bit if you're having trouble. The important thing is not to stop before reaching the steps.
* At the top, go through the middle door and approach the bell to initiate some scenes.
* Grab the Gizamaluke Bell from the chest and return to the previous area.
* Open the door on the left and get a Gizamaluke Bell from the wounded soldier at the end of the path.
* Return to the area with the big bell and enter the moogles' room.
* Make sure Zidane has the Butterfly Sword, Leather Shirt and Yellow Scarf equipped.
* Tell Moguta that you like Kupo Nuts, read the letter Mogmi received from Moodon and save your game.

**Target time**: 02:26:47

* Revive Quina and reset until he/she is revived with exactly 1 HP; revive Viva and Freya as well, if needed.
* Exit the room and enter the opposite door to faceâ¦

---

#### Battle: Gizamaluke (5 AP)

* If Zidane's turn comes up before Quina's then you can try to Steal once if you like - the 256/256 Elixir certainly won't hurt.
* Use Quina's Limit Glove!

* As Steiner, speak to the guards by the gate.
* Take the Multina Racket from the chest to the left of the gate, then speak to Part-time Worker Mary and choose whichever option you like.
* Next speak with the guy *repairing* the left gate and choose what you want here, too.
* Finally, talk to the guy on the far right and then make your way to the passageway.
* Open the chest for a Potion, take Grimo's letter to Nazna and board the cable car.

* Run about halfway towards Cleyra and save your game.

### Oak Staff detour

* Make your way to the coast. You may need to save again on the way, depending on how far you made it before your previous save.
* Call Choco, open the Chocograph menu and select Healing Shore.
* Dig up the Chocograph to get the Reef Transformation.
* After getting the transformation, head back to Gizamaluke's Grotto and save outside.

* Go through the grotto, still evading the Black Mage, then run a little in the direction of the Chocobo's Forest and save.
* Make your way to the Chocobo tracks outside Chocobo's Forest; call Choco.
* Unearth the *Streamside* (it's along the way and quite profitable) and the *Small beach* Chocographs.
* Return to Gizamaluke's Grotto, equip Vivi with your newly acquired Oak Staff and save.

**Target time**: 02:37:50

* Enter and engage the remaining Black Mage.

---

#### Battle: Type A x 2 (2 AP)

* Stop is much more effective than the Needle Fork + Add Status, so you shouldn't have too much trouble with this battle.
* Ideally you would finish this battle with 1 casting of Stop and 1 hit from the Needle Fork, but it's fine if you manage with 2 each as well.

> #### Gizamaluke Bells
> 
> * Actually, you can just evade the Black Mage again. Surprisingly, you will still find him running around the grotto even on Disc 4. Thanks to Kamy41 for testing and confirming this in 2015.
> * It's assumed that you fight the battle, but you stand to save between 40 seconds to over a minute by skipping it.
> * If you defeat the Black Mage and pick up the soldier's Gizamaluke Bell you'' be left with 1 bell and 1 closed door, at which point it will be up to you to decide what to do here on Disc 4.
> * The Gizamaluke Bell is just as unique a key item as the Athlete Queen or the coffees. Even if you decide to use it on Disc 4 to open the last door, it will still be visible that you got all of the bells. Or you can just leave the mage alone forever.

* Leave the grotto and save about halfway to Burmecia.

#### Battle: Type A x 2 (2 AP)

* You need to have Quina knocked out before reaching the save point so use the Needle Fork only for the first Type A. Once one of them is Stopped or Petrified have Quina Knocked out and use Stop for the win.
* You should aim to finish this battle within 4 Stop/Petrify attempts.
* If the battle doesn't go that well, don't reset. Finish and try to complete this segment without returning to the world map. If you make it to the end without encounters then the time you lost with a sub-par battle will be made up for by not having backtracked.

**Target time**: 02:42:22

* Run up the stairs to the right and head left until you reach a building with balconies inside.
* **Walk** across the plank to the chest with the Germinas Boots, then **run** back to make the plank fall to the level below.
* Return to where you fought the Type A's and go through the door on the left.
* Go upstairs, through the door and jump across the balconies on the outside.
* Speak to the dying soldier, then pick up the Protection Bell from behind the bed and the Ether from behind the cabinet.
* Now make your way back to the terrace with the locked door which you passed going to the Germinas Boots.
* Open and go through the door, then go up the stairs.

* Enter the doorway below the walkway, then return and take that walkway to the left door after the scene.
* Go through the next door to appear in a courtyard; enter the left door.
* Exit and enter the right door.
* Remove everyone's equipment.
* Open the chest in the back of the room, buy Stiltzkin's deal, deliver the letter to Atla, accept the letter to Monev and finally save your game.

#### Battle: Black Waltz #3 (5 AP)

* If you didn't get the Coral Ring from the Festival of the Hunt then you'll need to Steal the Lightning Staff (64/256 = 1/4).
* Attack physically with everyone, including Garnet.
* Don't heal or revive anyone since Black Waltz #3 will damage himself every other turn once Steiner and Marcus are knocked out.
* It's impossible to lose this battle unless you attack yourself, since Black Waltz #3 will never attack Garnet.

---

* At the fork, head **left**, in the direction of Dali.
* Save in the middle of Nolrich Heights, then enter Dali.

**Target time**: 02:58:00

* Revisit the shop and buy another 99 Wrist, as well as a Rod if you didn't get the Coral Ring during the Festival of the Hunt.
* Head to the farm plot to finally loot that elusive chest for an Elixir, and exit by way of the path to the right.

* Enter Treno and watch the ATE *Treno Tradition* (press X when the *!* appears to have him steal only 500 Gil as opposed to 1,000) and go down the left stairways.
* Go down the next set of stairs and enter the building across from the cafe.
* Speak to the Four-Armed Man to claim your Power Belt, then continue into the synthesis shop.
* Synthesize as many Cotton Robe as you can afford.
* Return outside and head past the Card Stadium.
* Enter the little tower to make Mogrich appear; run after him and read the letter he received from Stiltzkin, then save your game.

* Now go into the weapon shop, sell all the Cotton Robe you just bought and buy the following equipment:

* Next, optimize Steiner and activate MP Attack, Bird Killer and Counter.
* Challenge Griffin; use a Tent on him and then just attack physically. If the Tent is unsuccessful, reset and try again. The battle can go very fast if Steiner gets the first turn and Counter activates at some point.
* After the battle, return outside, watch the ATE *Unexpected Visitor*, and save your game once more.

**Target time**: 03:04:07

* Enter the Auction House to reunite with Garnet, then go back inside.

> #### Treno Auction House
> 
> * You need to win the Magician Robe, Madain's Ring, and Reflect Ring.
> * Although it's possible for all three to appear in a single auction, it's very rare, and then you still need to win them at a reasonable price, so I suggest you plan two auctions and save in between.
> * You should also bid on Griffin's Heart, Doga's Artifact and Une's Mirror; you can turn a nice profit by selling them to the nobles in from of the synthesis shop for 10,000, 10,000 and 15,000 Gil, respectively! Don't forget to refuse the first offers for Griffin's Heart and Une's Mirror. So make sure you win them at lower prices, obviously.
> * The table below shows the price ranges for the items as listed in the Ultimania, as well as their resell values; you should aim to win the items at no more than the average price, and for the items you don't need or have already won, bid the average value to hopefully push the auction to its final stages faster.
> * The Mini-Cid has a narrow price range, so bidding 2,000 to 2,400 should finish the auction fast without you actually buying the item. You should avoid buying it because it's the easiest item to skip and you will have to do this many times when buying all the Promist Ring later on Disc 3.
> * Keep in mind that only the total Gil spent matters, so you can spend a bit more on some items if you get others much cheaper. It total, you should aim to spend no more than around 65,000 Gil (including the key items which you should sell for a profit).
> * Exiting and re-entering takes around 7 seconds, so it's OK if you do it once or twice per attempt if needed.
>

* Buy as many Cotton Robe as you can!

* Now head over to the Treno inn and speak with Marcus.
* Go down towards the dock and speak to Baku; ignore Steiner completely or you won't make it to the bottom.

* After the attempted robbery, leave Treno and save midway to South Gate.

**Target time: 03:12:03**

* Head back to Dali and purchase another 99 Wrist.
* It's possible to reach the town without saving. Save on Nolrich Heights after you leave, and then try to make it to Treno without any more saves.

* Upon returning, go to Doctor Tot's tower and pick up the Mythril Dagger from the chest by the entrance.
* Speak with Doctor Tot once Marcus grabs the Supersoft, then climb the ladders and go down the hatch.
* Deliver Nazna's letter to Mochos and save your game.

* Save midway to the sandstorm.

**Target time**: 03:22:40

* Enter the sandstorm, flip the switch and go through the door which opens.
* Open the chest and continue onward.
* Loot both chests in this chamber; there is a hidden one behind the branch in the middle.
* Go all the way up the walkway outside, enter the top cave and choose to put Zidane's hand into the hole in the wall.
* Pick up the Ether from the chest, return outside and enter the ornate entrance by climbing the vines.
* Head into the tunnel-like passage and open both chests in the next area.

| | | | Millionaire |

* Equipping Zidane and then optimizing Vivi and Freya seems to give the best results with the least need for changes afterwards.
* Continue your ascent up the tree trunk, grabbing the Flame Staff and Potion.
* Once you reach Cleyra, refuse Oracle Kildea's tour and head to the inn area, picking up the Phoenix Pinion and Ore along the way.

* In the next screen, watch the ATE *There's a Mushroom!* and continue upwards to the cathedral.
* Speak with Tree Oracle Wylan and pick up the Yellow Scarf next to the entrance, then head back to the entrance of the settlement, plundering the treasures along the way.

* In the chamber after the bridge, I suggest going for the Remedy first, then continuing on through the little passage above the Remedy, which takes you to the exit at the top of the screen. Pick up the Mythril Gloves and return to the previous screen. Then, pick up the Mythril Vest and the Desert Boots and continue onward.
* Note that there is no need to manipulate the switch found at the end of the path with the Mythril Gloves. You will still be able to get the Elixir when going down the trunk as the sand will have stopped by itself by then.

* Loot the inn, read the letter from Ruby and save your game.

**Target time**: 03:31:15

#### Battle: Antlion (5 AP)

* Your aim here is to get Quina down to 1 HP and use Limit Glove.
* It requires a fair bit of luck, but the simplest and fastest way of getting this done is letting Antlion do it for you with his Sandstorm attack.
* You can let Zidane Steal - all of the items can be sold for some Gil.

* Skip all the dialogue that follows and choose whichever answer you want to the prompts.
* As Freya, go to the Cathedral and collect all the items inside; don't forget to speak to the High Priest to get an Emerald.
* Return to the inn, buy Stiltzkin's new deal, read the letter from Monev and save your game.

| Man Eater | | Add Status | HP+10%<br/>Distract |

* Head down the trunk, picking up the 4 treasures you skipped earlier.

---

#### Battle: Soldier x 2 (0 AP)

* Simply have Vivi cast a multi-target Bio spell; it will usually deal enough damage to make all the Soldiers escape.
* Keep Zidane's Attack menu open once Vivi's animation begins. If a Soldier becomes Poisoned, she may die from the Poison damage before she can escape. Keeping the menu open prevents this while still allowing the Soldiers to escape.
* If Bio doesn't deal sufficient damage, one attack from Zidane will finish the job.

---

#### Battle: Soldier x 2 (0 AP)

* Same as above.

---

* Use an Elixir on Vivi after this second battle.

---

#### Battle: Soldier x 2 (0 AP)

* Same as above.

---

#### Battle: Type B (1 AP)

* Have Quina attack with the Needle Fork and Vivi cast Stop.
* You should have enough MP for 3 castings of Stop, which should be enough to finish this battle.

#### Battle: Soldier x 3 (0 AP)

* If Vivi ends this battle with less than 8 MP then you'll need to use an Elixir first thing during the next battle.
* It's preferable to use it here if you get the chance, i.e. if not all of the Soldiers escape at once have Freya or Quina use the Elixir before Zidane attacks.

---

#### Battle: Type B x 2 (2 AP)

* Have Quina attack with the Needle Fork and Vivi cast Stop.
* Since this battle is so close to the save point, you shouldn't settle for any more than 4 castings of Stop.

* Tell the Cleyran Oracles to head right when prompted to choose a course of action.
* Before moving on, take a moment to revive and heal any hurt party members; Vivi needs at least 26 MP for the next battle, but preferably more.
* Tell Dan's wife and children to head to the left.

---

#### Battle: Soldier x 2 & Type B (1 AP)

* Your first priority is to use Bio to get rid of the Soldiers.
* Have Quina attack the Type B in hopes of Petrifying it, but make sure it has enough HP to absorb the hit; if Vivi cast Bio, then have Freya use a Hi-Potion on it before Quina attacks, or immediately afterwards if Vivi hasn't cast one yet.
* Of course, also cast Stop once the Soldiers are gone.

* Follow Freya and Vivi after overhearing Brahne on the airship, then immediately return to the previous screen to find Serino the moogle.
* Deliver the letter from Mopli, take the one from Serino and save your game once more.

* Return to the teleport pods and enter them by speaking to Vivi.

* Break out from the cage.
* You'll want to get through this area without a battle.
* It takes practice, but you can evade the soldiers by running straight towards them and then turning sharply just before you collide.
* Alternatively, you can try opening the disc cover or ejecting the disc tray while this screen is loading to create some choppiness and put the game into slow motion; the correct moment for opening the disc cover or ejecting the disc tray here is when you hear Steiner's armor clanking, but before the screen has fully rendered.
* Hug the railing to make the guards run next to it, then evade them when they get close to you. You can also use the columns on the wall to get the guards stuck in them and then run by.
* Another method you may want to try, courtesy of AtmaChild, is using the **pause** button. Pause whenever you get close to a guard, then make directional decisions by tilting the analog stick and resume the game. Repeating this multiple times per guard could help you evade them.

* Unequip Marcus before going onward after climbing the ladder! Give him the Iron Sword or Broadsword to replace the Mythril Sword if you equipped him with it earlier!

* After joining up with the rest of the party, run to where you first gained control of Steiner on Disc 1 and enter the door on the upper floor. Then, run straight and enter the center door to find the Queen's chamber.
* Pull the purple lamp and enter the secret passage.
* Open both chests before proceeding further and equip Steiner with the Ice Brand, Bronze Helm, Mythril Gloves, Chain Mail and Power Belt; activate his Man Eater, MP Attack and Counter abilities.
* Place Steiner and Zidane in the front row, and Freya and Vivi in the back row.
* Run all the way to the bottom of the pit and enter the chapel.

---

#### Battle: Zorn & Thorn (0 AP)

* Have Steiner attack Thorn, Freya attack whichever one gets the power up, and then Vivi cast a multi-target Blizzard spell on the party, in that order.
* The Blizzard spell should bring Steiner, Zidane and Vivi to critical HP, in preparation for the upcoming battle against Beatrix.
* Finish the battle with another attack from Steiner against Thorn.
* You can have Zidane Steal when he gets a chance, but you don't really need any of their items.

---

* You should reach Garnet by 26:00.
* Exchange Zidane's Leather Hat for a Bandana and activate his Man Eater ability.
* Read the letter Mosh received from Kupo and save your game.

### Alexandra Rescue

###### Notes

This is one of the most difficult parts of this challenge, so come armed with plenty of patience. Although your survival still depends on some luck, the strategies and equipment here maximize your chances of survival, so the difficult thing will be getting through this segment quickly, rather than at all. If there's any circuit where you can cut yourself some slack, then this one is definitely a major candidate.

* Run all the way back to the Queen's chamber to confront Beatrix.

---

#### Battle: Beatrix 3 (0 AP)

* Have Steiner attack, Zidane attack, and Vivi use a Phoenix Down to revive Freya as necessary.
* Rinse and repeat.
* You can also Steal once or twice, but none of the items are needed.

---

#### Battle: Bandersnatch (2 AP)

* Simply have Freya attack physically, then wait until she is knocked out somehow (either by herself or the enemy) before using Climhazzard to win the battle (Beatrix is fully healed before the next battle she'll be in, so you can afford to use Climhazzard here).
* If Beatrix is knocked out, just use a Phoenix Down; Bandersnatch can only target 1 character per turn, so it will eventually take care of Freya for you, letting you defeat it with Beatrix.

---

* After the battle, place everyone in the back row and make some changes to your party's equipment:

| Zidane | Steiner | Vivi | Garnet |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Mythril Dagger<br/>Bandana<br/>Bone Wrist<br/>Mythril Vest<br/>Reflect Ring | Ice Brand<br/>Mythril Helm<br/>Silver Gloves<br/>Chain Mail<br/>Coral Ring | Oak Staff<br/>Mage's Hat<br/>Bone Wrist<br/>Magician Robe<br/>Madain's Ring | Mythril Rod<br/>Mage's Hat<br/>Glass Armlet<br/>Silk Robe<br/>Gold Choker |
| Auto-Reflect<br/>Auto-Potion | HP+10%<br/>Insomniac | Auto-Potion | Auto-Potion |

* Continue down the steps and get ready for the biggest Stop-fest in the game.

---

#### Battle: Type C x 3 (2 AP)

* Cast Stop non-stop >__>
* Have Garnet cast multi-target Silence on all the Type C's until they are all either Stopped or Silenced.
* Zidane can Steal to grab some Potion and/or Tent, and Steiner should Defend and throw Phoenix Down, Potion and/or Elixir if necessary.
* Concentrate your efforts on the Type C at the top of the list - for some reason it's stronger than the other two.
* Rejoice if you manage to finish without having to use an Elixir!

---

* Replace Vivi's Madain's Ring with the second Coral Ring and activate his Insomniac ability. Also remove Steiner's Silver Gloves.
* Revive and heal anyone that needs it, use an Elixir Vivi if he has no MP left, and continue down the stairs.

---

#### Battle: Bandersnatch x 2 (2 AP)

* You're pretty much invincible so just spam Stop until the battle ends.
* Again, you can Steal to get back some Potion and also Tent.

---

* Once the battle is over, **revive and heal Steiner** before continuing down the stairs!

---

#### Battle: Bandersnatch (2 AP)

* If you make it past this battle having use only 1 (or even none!) Elixir on Vivi up to this point then you've had a very good run!
* Below is a summary of relevant AP gains for this series of battles:

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Zidane | Auto-Reflect<br/>Distract<br/>Man Eater<br/>Insomniac<br/>Auto-Potion | 6/95<br/>6/30<br/>15/25<br/>15/30<br/>15/30 |
| Vivi | Insomniac | 4/25 |

---

* After this point, there's nothing you can do from a survival standpoint except hope that luck is on your side.
* Everything you accomplished so far will now depend on how full Beatrix's and Steiner's ATB gauges will be at the start of the upcoming battles.

---

#### Battle: Bandersnatch x 2 (2 AP)

* Use Climhazzard as quickly as possible.

---

#### Battle: Bandersnatch x 2 (2 AP)

* Have Steiner use an Elixir on Beatrix as soon as possible, then wait for him to get knocked out somehow (either by himself or an enemy) before using Climhazzard to end this last battle.
* If Beatrix is knocked out, don't reset - just use a Phoenix Down. Steiner won't go down as quickly as it may seem if he's got the Coral Ring and is in the back row.
* If Steiner is knocking himself out, open Beatrix's Seiken menu the moment he acts and wait to see whether he is successful as you wouldn't want to redo all of this if he happens to survive or miss! This also stops the Bandersnatches' ATB gauges from filling up during the animation. Use Climhazzard once you see that Steiner is in fact knocked out.

---

* As if all this wasn't enough, you can still run into a random battle after regaining control of Zidane's group. Don't move before you equip him with the Dagger, then head for the chapel.
* If you do get a battle, just use Flee as soon as possible; don't reset, as the 30-45 seconds a battle would take is little compared to how much time you could lose due to a bad luck with Stop - not to mention real-life time.

* Accept the letter from Monty, then finally save your game!

#### Battle: Ralvuimago (7 AP)

* Have Vivi cast Blizzara, Zidane Steal and Garnet attack physically, in that order.
* The boss will coil up, but will not attack while in this state.
* While he is coiled up, have Zidane Steal. Wait for the boss to uncoil then rinse and repeat the attack pattern.
* It takes 3 Blizzara spells to win.
* You can also skip Garnet's attack during the first round and hope the boss doesn't use Thundara - this saves a round of coiling.
* Make sure you Steal the Adaman Vest (64/256) - you will soon need it for fighting Lani.

* Once you gain control of Garnet, head straight back to the crash site to find the ending of the Hero's Tale.
* Return and run leftwards on the top path to find another piece of the story.
* Deliver Mosh's letter to Monty and save your game.

**Target time**: 04:32:54

* Pinnacle Rocks is theoretically skippable, but since you're collecting all the treasure, you may as well get the story pieces; they're right next to the chests, after all.

* Open the chest at the bottom of the slope, then find another segment of the story below the top path in a little cove.
* Go left and approach the chest to find yet another part, and open the chest afterwards.
* Go up the branch and around to jump down to the chest below; find the fifth piece of the story near this chest.
* Return and go past the point where you jumped to meet Ramuh. Recite the story with the ending you wish and attempt to leave Pinnacle Rocks.
* When given the choice to jump off from the ledge, choose **not** to and return to Monty to read the letter he received from Stiltzkin, save, and then leave Pinnacle Rocks. Monty is unreachable on Disc 4, meaning in won't be visible whether you read this letter or not, so if you don't care about it then you can jump off and save about a minute.

* In Lindblum, enter the inn, deliver Serino's letter, accept Moodon's letter and read the letter from Ruby; save if you wish.
* Exit the inn and head to the market square, taking care not to trigger the scene with the crowd around the black mage. Do this by walking as close as possible to the left side of the screen.
* At the square, search Card Freak Gon's house and the rubble to the left of it, then head to the shopping area to initiate some scenes.

* You'll find yourself in the shopping area afterwards, so drop by the synthesis shop and buy yourself an Exploda.
* Take an aircab to the Theater District, and loot Artist Michael's studio and the Tantalus hideout. Then, speak to Lowell outside the hideout to recruit him into Ruby's theater in Alexandria.
* Return to the Business District and tell the man that you're ready to leave.

* Deliver Moodon's letter to Moonte at the Dragon's Gate, then save.

> #### Moguta's Elixir
> 
> * You may want to make a short detour to Gizamaluke's Grotto and give Moguta a Kupo Nut. The first one you give him on Disc 2 is rewarded with an Elixir, which, while not quite a unique treasure, **is** a unique reward from Moguta.
> * All other Kupo Nut rewards are a random item out of 3, except this Elixir and an Extension on Disc 3, both of which count toward your Treasure Hunting Rank. The Extension can be picked up in around 30 seconds while doing something else, but this Elixir requires an extra 2 minutes. The target times do include this.
> 
> **Time**: +2:00

* Use a Gysahl Greens to call Choco and ride to Gizamaluke's Grotto.
* Head inside, give Moguta the Kupo Nut, and head back out.
* Make the following changes to your equipment.

| Zidane | Vivi | Garnet |
|--------|------|--------|

* Save outside Qu's Marsh.

**Target time**: 04:45:22

* Enter the marsh and find Quina by the pond.
* Take the right path from Quale's hut to find the entrance to Fossil Roo.
* Enter and run from Armodullahan; run along the upper side in the first area, the lower side in the second and once again the upper side in the last area to ensure it doesn't catch up to you.

---

#### Battle: Lani (0 AP)

* Simply have Vivi attack Zidane for a guaranteed 18 damage, then fire off with Lucky seven to (with some luck) promptly end the battle!

---

* Now comes the *hard* part: run all the way back to the entrance to get the Elixir from Armodullahan's cage and return to go on.
* Before you go to fetch the Elixir, revive your party, optimize Zidane, and equip him with the Dagger and Vivi with the Ice Staff and Silk Robe. Then optimize the others' equipment and activate everyone's Insomniac abilities (from Bandana or Coral Ring) as well as Vivi's loudmouth.
* The 3-part path with the swinging blades actually counts as one long screen so it is virtually impossible to make it to the Elixir and back with no random battles. The target times assume 5 encounters, but it's possible to make it through with just 4, and acceptable if you get 6.

* You need Quina to learn Night along the way, so encounter a party of 2 Abomination. Cast Blizzara on 1 of them to be able to Eat it successfully. You should do this while getting the Elixir to make the most of the battles you'll have. You can also learn Night by Eating a Seeker Bat, but it's easier to learn it from Abomination.

* Go down the steps where you fought Lani once you get the Elixir.
* Pick the flowers and call Gargant to get to a larger cavern with moogles and a treasure hunter.
* Unequip everyone's gear, buy Stiltzkin's latest deal, read the letter Mogki received, and save.

**Target time**: 04:55:41 (+12:20) **Target Gil**: 45,725 **Encounters**: 5

###### Notes

If you are running very late and don't anticipate yourself making up any time in future circuits, then you may want to consider skipping the Elixir in Fossil Roo. This is most definitely a sacrifice on your part, but if you can live with having missed 1 treasure, then this is the best opportunity to save time in the entire game when you consider what you have to consider what you have to sacrifice; you'll save around 7 minutes at the cost of a common Elixir. However, the target times assume that you pick it up.

Likewise, you could skip the Elixir (what a coincidence) from Moguta.

* Head right to find Mogryo; take the letter addressed to Mocchi.
* Return to the entrance of the village and take a left. Open the ATE menu and watch *Different Language*, then go left until Vivi runs the other way.
* Now go to the inn, talk to Vivi and choose *Rest* to go to sleep.

* In the morning, head over to Mogryo to read the letter he received from Stiltzkin. He got it overnight, but will no longer have his letter for Mocchi in the morning (I guess Artemicion beat you to it when delivering Stiltzkin's letter!).
* Visit the synthesis shop (pick up the 2,000 Gil there):

| Items bought | Quantity | Gil |
|--------------|:--------:|----:|
| **Gil before** | | 124,245 |
| Cotton Robe<br/>Barette | 99<br/>1 | 99,000<br/>1,800 |
| **Gil after** | | 23,445 |

* Next, climb the ladder and overhear the brief conversation below. Then go back down and enter the item shop.
* Pick up the Ether, then cash in on the 99 Cotton Robe you just synthesized, and buy 10 Potion and 5 Soft.
* Tell the shopkeeper you want *the usual*, then climb the ladder behind the counter and grab the Black Belt from the chest hanging from the ceiling!

* The shopping isn't over! Make your way back to the equipment shop:

| Items bought | Quantity | Gil |
|--------------|:--------:|----:|
| **Gil before** | | 220,445 |
| Magic Armlet<br/>Steepled Hat<br/>Headgear<br/>Ritual Hat<br/>Leather Plate<br/>Chain Plate<br/>Mythril Vest | 1<br/>99<br/>1<br/>3<br/>1<br/>2<br/>8 | 1,000<br/>25,740<br/>330<br/>3,000<br/>530<br/>1,620<br/>9,440 |
| **Gil after** | | 178,785 |

* That's right, another Cotton Robe trick is in the works!

* Once you're finally done shopping, leave the Black Mage Village and head straight to Conde Petie.

* Pick up the Gil behind one of the beds in the inn, the head up the stairs and climb onto the boat to find a Diamond.
* Talk to the dwarf blocking the top right exit, then go to the corridor outside the inn and speak to Father Heavenguard.
* After the ceremony, you may choose to let Quina and Vivi get married. It only takes an extra 15 seconds so I'd do it :)
* Either way, save near the grocery shop.

**Target time**: 05:15:44 (+9:20) **Target Gil**: 180,585 **Encounter**: 1

* Go past the weapon shop and on the Conde Petie Mountain Path.
* Eiko will join your party at Lv 1.
* After meeting Eiko, head further along the path until you spot a group of Oglops; catch one and return to Conde Petie.
* Go to the young boy behind the grocery shop, tell him your favorite dish (he likes Seasoned Oglops) and hive him the Oglop for the Oglop Card.
* Save in the grocery store.

* Return to the Mountain Path and get the rest of the treasure, then keep going until you find Stiltzkin and Suzuna.

* Climb the vines to the left of the moogles and keep going until you get ambushed byâ¦

#### Battle: Hilgigars (9 AP)

* Ideally, you would want Eiko to attack Zidane, Vivi cast Fira, and Zidane finish the battle with 7,777 frim Luck Seven - all in 1 round.
* Vivi and Eiko with both deal a guaranteed 18 damage to Zidane with regular attacks, setting him up for Lucky Seven.
* Hilgigars can counter with Curaga if his HP gets low, so try not to cast Lucky Seven before you've lowered his HP below 7,777 with a Fira or regular attack from Zidane.
* Garnet can cast Float on the party if she gets a chance.

| Character | Ability | AP points |

| Zidane | Bird Killer<br/>Man Eater<br/>Insomniac<br/>Auto-Potion<br/>Sacrifice<br/>Lucky Seven | \* \* \*<br/>\* \* \*<br/>\* \* \*<br/>\* \* \*<br/>9/55<br/>9/85 |

* Ignore the remaining treasures on the Mountain Path for the time being and save midway to Madain Sari.

* Enter Madain Sari.
* As soon as you can move, exit to the bottom right, then immediately return. Zidane with say a few things after which the ATE *Eiko's Feelings* will be triggered. When asked to distribute jobs, just keep pressing X and choose the default positions.
* Pick up the Tent from the chest hidden behind Garnet, then head over to Eiko's house and try to enter; Morrison will appear and invite you to the Eidolon Wall.
* Next, head back to the entrance of Madain Sari and take Garnet with you.

> #### The perfect dinner
> 
> * A new ATE, *Eiko's Kitchen*, will be triggered upon returning to the fountain area. Getting the best dinner only changes some dialogues, but if you want to trigger it, then do the following:
>     - Pour enough water for 11 people
>     - Don't add the seasoned Oglop
>     - Help the moogle with the fishing rod
> * The ATE *Eiko's Kitchen 2* will trigger after you leave the Eidolon Wall. Watch it and let Quina help Eiko.
> * The target times do not include this, so add 1:30 if you do it.
> 
> **Time**: +1:30

* Head over to the Eidolon Wall and enter.
* Leave Garnet, then go to Eiko's house to finally eat.

* After the meal, loot the two chests in the room and bring the pot to Eiko on the back porch - speak with her.
* Don't forget to pick up the Kirman Coffee, then try to leave the house; choose *Sleep* when the moogle stops you at the door.
* Eiko will decide to go with you in the morning after all, so leave Madain Sari and save on your way to the Mountain Path.

**Target time**: 05:30:47

* Go onto the Mountain Path once again.
* Follow the descending vine to the Green Stone and an Ether, then return and continue onward to find the Yellow Stone at the intersection.

> #### The colored stones side-quest
> 
> * The 4 colored stones you have collected can now be exchanged for a Moonstone. Simply make your way back to Suzuna and head down the path to the right.
> * Put all 4 colored stones onto statue to receive a Moonstone, then return to the fork where you fought Hilgigars.
> 
> * This is an optional side-quest. The colored stones and the Moonstone are all unique items, so it's a matter of taste.
> * By keeping the stones you can keep 4 unique items, but leave the side-quest incomplete. Exchanging them gives you only 1 unique item, but also a full set of Moonstone - and completes the side-quest.
> * The decision is yours, but the target times assume you do exchange the items, so subtract 1:00 from the times if you decide to skip this.
> 
> **Time**: +1:00

* Return to the fork where you fought Hilgigars and take a left.
* Equip your characters as follows, then run up to the base of the Iifa Tree and save your game.

| Zidane | Garnet | Vivi | Eiko |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| Dagger<br/>Ritual Hat<br/>Mythril Armlet<br/>Survival Vest<br/>Sapphire | Mythril Rod<br/>Lamia's Tiara<br/>Magic Armlet<br/>Magician Robe<br/>Madain's Ring | Ice Staff<br/>Headgear<br/>-<br/>-<br/>- | Multina Racket<br/>-<br/>-<br/>Silk Shirt<br/>- |
| High Tide<br/>Protect Girls<br/>Auto-Potion | | Auto-Potion | |

* Enter the Iifa Tree and choose to *Ask Eiko* when given a prompt.
* Give Eiko the Ruby you receive from breaking the seal.
* Go along the roots until you find Mocchi, for whom you have a letter to deliver.
* It's very unlikely, but it's possible to make it to Mocchi without any battles. However, the times do account for one.

* In order to get through the Iifa Tree without collecting EXP, you'll need to get a character under Zombie status. Garnet makes a good candidate.
* With the equipment listed in the previous circuit, with Shell status and with full HP, Garnet will always survive a Dracozombie's Zombie Breath.
* You need to encounter a Dracozombie before heading onto the green platform that takes you down to Soulcage. Run from all other encounters as usual.

---

#### Battle: Dracozombie (0 AP)

* Have Zidane or Eiko throw a Tent, then have Vivi cast Blizzara on the entire party to knock everyone out, and finish with Garnet casting Shell on herself.
* Wait for Zombie Breath, recasting Shell if necessary, and then end the battle by casting Life on the Dracozombie.
* If the first Tent doesn't succeed, throw a second one before knocking out the party with Vivi, or wait to see if you need a third.

---

* After the battle, revive and heal only Zidane; make sure he has High Tide and Protect Girls activated, and that he is in the back row.
* Equip Garnet with a Mythril Vest and Coral Ring but remove her Magic Armlet.
* Also equip Vivi with the Oak Staff, Magician Robe and Peridot.

> #### Trance gauge prep
> 
> * Although it's still a very long way off, you need to prepare Zidane for his show-down with Shell Dragon towards the end of Disc 3. That means filling up his Trance gauge so that is his 2 or 3 hits away from full.
> * The gauge goes from 0 to 255. Without High Tide, each hit fills it by a random amount between 0 and Zidane's SPR. Zidane won't have High Tide activated during Pandemonium battles and his SPR will be 23. This means he will need his gauge to be at least 231, but that's only a 1/24 chance of getting filled from a single attack. You'll want to get most of the filling done here since you'll get attacked often and can still survive attacks.
> * With the equipment listed earlier and High Tide, each hit here will fill Zidane's gauge by 26. Do some testing to find out how many hits he needs to trigger Trance so that you have some orientation. Filling it to just above the B in the ATB bar is a good rule of thumb, since you still need to leave some room for boosts in the future.
> * The only attack Zidane can survive now is the Strike used by Zombie. They appear in groups of 2 or 3. However, don't spend more than 2 rounds taking hits, because they can use Melt and Roulette as well.
> * You are guaranteed to face a party of Zombie on the way down to Soulcage. 2 rounds of 3 attacks each will fill Zidane's gauge by around 60%. You can do most of your Trance gauge filling there. However, if it's not enough, then 1 random battle with Zombies on the way to the green leaf platform should be enough
> * From this point on, reset the game if Zidane ever enters Trance.

* For subsequent random encounters, have Zidane use Flee as soon as possible. If the enemy attacks Garnet, he will cover her thanks to Protect Girls, but be sure to heal him back up to full HP after each encounter. If Zidane gets knocked out, then simply have Eiko knock herself out before Garnet casts Life if you're facing Dracozombie, or uses a Soft if up against Stroper.
* Zombies shouldn't pose a problem if Zidane is equipped properly, and you can use them for Trance gauge filling if needed.
* If Garnet gets healed by Dracozombie's Thundara, have her attack herself to return to half HP before Zidane uses Flee. This way Protect Girls will still be able to trigger in subsequent battles.

* Follow the path down until you reach a little niche with a switch on the left side of the screen; press the switch.
* Now return up 1 screen and pick up all the treasure which you skipped earlier (the Healing Rod appears only after pressing the switch mentioned above). You may want to exit this screen after picking up the chest at the bottom in order to reset the encounter rate.
* There is another switch in this screen as well, and it makes a chest with a Phoenix Down drop from above.
* Continue your descent down the tree and pick up the remaining treasures at the ends of the path.
* Make sure you revive everyone and heal Zidane and Vivi before stepping onto the green leaf platform! Keep an eye on Garnet's MP if you're using her spells - she will need at least 8 MP remaining after the following forced encounters. You can use Eiko's Cure spell to save some Potions.

---

#### Battle: Zombie x 2/3 (0 AP)

* Garnet and Eiko will be untouchable thanks to Zidane's Protect Girls, and Vivi can survive their attacks and heal automatically.
* Spend the first and/or second round filling up Zidane's Trance gauge by blocking their Strike attacks. Throw Elixir at the ones who have already acted to reduce the chances of them using Melt or Roulette.

* Once satisfied with your gauge, simply have Zidane and Eiko throw an Elixir at all but the last Zombie, then wait for the remaining Zombie to make its move. Cross your fingers that it isn't Melt.
* Once it has attacked, make Vivi cast Thundara on the party to knock out everyone except Garnet, and have her throw one more Elixir to win the battle!

---

* There will be some dialogue after this battle, and then you will gain momentarily control of Zidane; **revive Vivi and Eiko**, but don't heal them.
* Keep Zidane knocked out for the time being because we wouldn't want him hit with Zombie Breath during the next fight.
* Once you're ready, talk to Vivi to trigger a battle with anotherâ¦

---

#### Battle: Dracozombie (0 AP)

* All you need to win this battle is for the Dracozombie to attack someone other than Garnet.
* Once it does, have the remaining character knock themselves out and Garnet throw an Elixir to win the battle.
* If Garnet is knocked out, don't reset! You can still win by casting Stop with Vivi - have Eiko cast Reflect on him or throw a Tent at the Dracozombie.
* Unless Vivi and Garnet both start out with full ATB gauges, wait for the monster to attack before you input your commands. Since you never know how full the enemy's ATB gauge is, it could happen that you tell Vivi to knock himself and Eiko out only for the enemy to get its turn just before Garnet throws Elixir, with no one but her left to target!

---

* You will now finally reach the bottom. Use Phoenix Down on Vivi and Eiko, but do **not** revive Zidane!
* Pick up the Elixir and the Brigandine.
* Remove all of Zidane's equipment, then equip him with the Black Belt and activate his HP+20% ability.
* Have Garnet cast Life to revive Zidane with exactly 37 HP - perfect for Lucky Seven!
* Afterwards, equip Zidane as follows:

| Zidane |
|--------|
| Mythril Dagger<br/>Bandana<br/>Mythril Armlet<br/>Brigandine<br/>Reflect Ring |
| Ability Up |

* Also take a moment to cure Garnet's Zombie status, equip her with the Silk Robe and Madain's Ring, and activate her Ability Up ability.

* Finally, go to the bottom of the screen and inspect the ledge. Run over to Garnet once the area begins to shake to faceâ¦

---

#### Battle: Soulcage (9 AP)

* â¦the easiest boss in the game.
* Just chuck another Elixir to finally be done with this section!

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Zidane | Auto-Reflect<br/>Distract<br/>Bandit<br/>Ability Up | 31/95<br/>\* \* \*<br/>18/40<br/>18/95 |
| Garnet | Chemist | \* \* \* |

---

* Breathe a sigh of relief and save once you exit the Iifa Tree area!

**Target time**: 05:50:19

* Place Zidane in the front row, and swap some of his gear so that he has the Exploda and Power Belt; activate his Distract, MP Attack, Man Eater and Ability Up abilities!
* Head back to the Conde Petie Mountain Path and head straight for the other exit.
* Save again outside Madain Sari.

**Target time**: 05:51:23 (+17:45) **Target Gil**: 189,303 **Encounters**: 6

* Enter and follow Eiko into the room below the back porch.
* Loot the two chests, then run to the Eidolon Wall after Lani kidnaps Eiko.
* **Do not** choose to have your party healed here.

---

#### Battle: Scarlet Hair (9 AP)

* Attack once, then proceed to spam Lucky Seven until you win.
* You can use Lucky Seven when he's moving around.
* It's possible to win within just 2 rounds; Zidane's attack must hit for at least 1,209 damage for this to work.

* Remove Garnet's equipment, but make sure she is equipped with the Mythril Rod.
* Head back to the room below the porch, where Eiko will decide to leave Madain Sari.
* Afterwards, examine the field icon outside Eiko's house to find Garnet.
* Back at the entrance, Amarant joins the party at Lv1. Switch out Garnet for Amarant and head back out onto the Lucid Plains; save your game!

**Target time**: 06:03:05

* Place everyone in the back row and equip your party as follows:

| Zidane | Amarant | Vivi | Eiko |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| Dagger<br/>Ritual Hat<br/>Mythril Armlet<br/>Adaman Vest<br/>Black Belt | Cat's Claws<br/>Ritual Hat<br/>Bone Wrist<br/>Adaman Vest<br/>Coral Ring | Oak Staff<br/>Ritual Hat<br/>Magic Armlet<br/>Magician Robe<br/>Power Belt | Lamia's Flute<br/>-<br/>Bone Wrist<br/>-<br/>- |
| HP+20%<br/>Insomniac<br/>Auto-Potion | Insomniac | Insomniac<br/>Auto-Potion |

* Go through the Conde Petie Mountain Path one last time and run to and enter the Iifa Tree.
* Get the scenes out of the way, then swap out Amarant for Garnet and go back onto the Pualei Plains to save the game.

> #### Base stats
> 
> * You are now officially finished with the Lv 1 Game! From this point onwards, you can gain as much EXP as you want, with anyone you want.
> * The only restriction is that your characters should not have any gear that raises Speed, Strength, Magic or Spirit when they level up.
> * You may want to spend some time gaining EXP to make the rest of the game that much easier.

**Target time**: 06:05:10 (+13:47) **Target Gil**: 194,093 **Encounters**: 0

### Pualei Plains &rarr; Start of Disc 3

* You will need to get past 3 Mistodon without gaining EXP. Although it's possible to get the Zombie from a Dracozombie on the roots, this is not time-efficient, and due to some strange programming, you will still have to get past the second battle with Stop. Therefore, it's advisable to focus your equipment and strategy on Stop for the whole segment.

* Re-enter the Iifa Tree and just along the familiar roots until you get a scene.
* At the top, simply cancel the prompt and choose Finished.

---

#### Battle: Mistodon x 2 (3 AP)

* Vivi casts Stop non-stop (yes, pun intended) >__>
* Garnet and Eiko should cast Silence every chance they get until both Mistodon are Silence'd. Use spread spells until they connect with at least one monster - then switch over to single-target casting. You need this because Vivi is weak to Fire with his Magician Robe.
* Zidane should throw Tent at whichever Mistodon has not been inflicted with Silence yet. After that, he should distribute Phoenix Down - you want as many characters as possible to be conscious at the start of the next battle!
* Zidane and Vivi will survive most attacks and heal up automatically with Auto-Potion. There is random variance in each attack, but they should survive all but the strongest hits.

---

* For no particular reason, your party is healed of their status effects at this point, but their HP isn't replenished. They're not even revived, which would be extremely helpful. This is the reason why Zombie isn't worth it in this segment.

---

#### Battle: Mistodon (2 AP)

* Your party will begin this battle in exactly the same state they were in at the end of the previous one (except for status ailments).
* The tactics here are basically the same as for the previous battle.
* Once the Mistodon is hit with Silence, be sure to revive as many characters as possible in order to distract the monster from Vivi.

---

* After the battle, revive your characters, remove all gear from Vivi and Eiko, and give Amarant the Power Belt.
* Read the letter from Stiltzkin and save with Mocchi, who is hiding behind the tree trunk.

**Target time**: 06:12:22

* Run down the root. You should aim to have only 1 battle and end it with 1 or 2 castings of Stop. Make sure Amarant survives the battle and gets 2 AP towards his MP Attack ability.

**Target time**: 06:17:31 (+11:46) **Target Gil**: 194,093 **Encounters**: 1

* You will eventually gain control of Vivi outside Alexandria pub. Go right and down the street until you spot Hippaul and his mother near the bottom. Talk to his mother to initiate a mini-game. You must now raise Hippaul to Lv 80 to receive the Athlete Queen.

> #### Racing Hippaul for the Athlete Queen
> 
> * Winning a race 1 second (or more) ahead of Hippaul will raise his Lv to the nearest multiple of 5. You should easily be able to reach Lv 40 within 8 races.
> * Running to the steeple, saving and running back to Hippaul takes 1 minute, which is equivalent to 3 races. Therefore, you actually save about 20 seconds by saving between consecutive 5-Lv races instead of gaining 1 Lv at a time.
> * Once you reach Lv 40, save the game, and then try your best to get to Lv 60 within another 4 races, saving between each attempt. It **is** possible, albeit difficult.
> * Do the last 20 races one Lv at a time, preferably without any more saving in between.
> 
> * Here are some tips:
>     - Use both hands.
>     - Use the same fingers in both hands; it helps your coordination.
>     - Try to use different sets of fingers, saving your best for last.
>     - Take extended breaks between saves to allow your hands to rest.
>     - Turn off the volume - the music's rhythm can be distracting.
>     - Try changing the button configuration if you think it'll help.
>  
> * If you don't save at all, get to Lv 60 in 12 races, and do the last 20 flawlessly, then it takes 9:40 before you're back outside the pub.
> * If you're a human, then Lv 60 is as far as you can hop to get before you have to do the races 1 Lv at a time. If you're an inventor, then it's possible to build contraptions that let you reach Lv 80 in just 16 races. And no, turbo controllers don't work.
> * The target times assume you **do** get the Athlete Queen.
> 
> **Time**: +9:40

* When heading to the steeple for the first time, be sure to watch the ATE *Artemicion* which is triggered when you enter the main square.
* Climb up the ladder in the bell tower and ring the bell to find a stash of 5 Tetra Master cards.
* Search the house to the right of the bell tower for Eye Drops and 3 Gil if you did not do so on Disc 1. In order to reach the second floor, keep running into the girl and eventually you'll pass through her; this doesn't work on Disc 1, for some reason.
* Buy Stiltzkin's new offer and finally deliver Kuppo's letter to his little brother Kupo! Kupo should also have a letter from Mogrika if you watched the ATE mentioned above.
* After getting the Athlete Queen, don't bother returning to save right away; instead, go into Ruby's mini-theater. A long sequence of scenes will play out and eventually you will gain control of Zidane in the pub.
* Search the pub for the items which you skipped at the start of the game (Potion, Flan Card, 27 Gil).
* Head for the bell tower once again to read a letter Kupo received from Stiltzkin, and finally save your game with the Athlete Queen.

**Target time**: 06:44:01

* Now make your way to the dock: grab the 2,680 Gil in Ruby's theater, and pick up the Phoenix Pinion and 3,927 Gil at the dock, then take the boat to the castle. You can also unequip everyone now.
* Search the castle dock for an Ether, Phoenix Pinion, and Lapis Lazuli, then go left and enter the tower to find another Phoenix Pinion; this one is missable!
* Enter the castle and another long sequence begins; you'll regain control of the party in Treno.

* Exit Doctor Tot's Tower and watch the ATE *Memories By The Water*, then go to the Card Stadium and watch the ATE *City People*; you should get a Chimera Armlet from the Four-Armed Man.
* Since you're already here, register for the tournament and win the first two matches. It should be relatively easy to win with the Tantarian, Shiva, Ramuh, Nova Dragon, and Armstrong cards.
* Afterwards, run over to Mogrich and read the letter he received from Kupo.

> #### Lv 1 Path & Combined
> 
> * If you're not planning to do the Promist Ring detour, then save with Mogrich and then attend one auction to purchase the Dark Matter.
> * If you're playing the Lv 1 Path and want Zidane with **combined** stats, then you have to win the Dark Matter here regardless of whether you will do the Promist Ring detour or not.
> 
> **Time**: +2:00 **Gil**: -18,000

* Exit Treno and save about midway to South Gate.

**Target time**: 06:57:02 (+38:31) **Target Gil**: 199,953 **Encounters**: 0

* Enter Dali and reminisce a bit at the shop, then get down to business:

| **Gil after** | | 145,503 |

* Be sure to sell **all but 3** Ore!

* Next, go into the mayor's house and choose to search the room.
* Check the desk for the Mini-Brahne, then check it 2 more times so that the sleeping boy says *Zzzâ¦*, and then check the heater for the Mayor's Key and leave.
* Enter the windmill and use the Mayor's Key on the door to enter the Chocobo pen; open the chest for 30,000 Gil and then check it again to discover the Burman Coffee.
* Return to the windmill and take the ladder to the upper area; open the chests for a Cachusha and an Elixir, then leave Dali.

* Regardless of whether you wish to trade in the coffees, enter Observatory Mountain in order to mark it on the World Map (credits to AtmaChild).

> #### Mr. Morrid's coffees & the Mini Prima Vista
> 
> * This side-quest is very much like the 4 colored stones from the Conde Petie Mountain Path: either you keep 3 unique key items but leave the side-quest incomplete, or you trade them in to complete it and have the Mini Prima Vista displayed in the Tantalus hideout.
> * Morrid will be sitting on the steps outside: simply speak to him to trigger some scenes, and that's it.
> * The target times include this detour, so subtract 0:30 from the times if you choose to skip it.
> 
> **Time**: +0:30

* Save midway to South Gate, then go through it and save midway to Treno.

</table>

* Go to the Card Stadium and defeat the champion for the Rebirth Ring.

* Order Blutzen & Kohel to gather information, then just mash the X button to choose the remaining defaults; Garnet should receive the Angel Earrings.

* Once you regain control, remove all of Steiner's equipment, optimize Beatrix and place her in the back row.
* Skip the very first Mistodon by hugging the right wall and waiting for it to come around the tent. Once it is about halfway there, run around the left side of tent and dash to the exit, running around the far left side of the screen, left of the cart.

* Knock out Steiner in the first battle which follows, and then proceed to clear the way with Beatrix's Life spell. Climhazzard will not be powerful enough to defeat 2 Mistodon, so don't bother.
* After the battle outside, the pub, take a moment to remove your equipment from Beatrix and cast Cura to heal up; this is your last chance to access the menu.
* In the last screen, you will face 3 single Mistodon, and then a pair. Don't forget to use an Elixir on Beatrix before she defeats the third and last single Mistodon, and use Full-Life from that point onwards for higher accuracy (Life can sometimes miss due to Mistodon's Magi Evade).

* As Garnet, make your way to the top of the castle to trigger more scenes.
* When you gain control of the rest of the party, head up the stairway and to the guardhouse.
* Equip Zidane with the Exploda, Ritual Hat, Bone Wrist, Survival Vest and Black Belt; activate his HP+20%, Distract, and Antibody abilities, but **do not** heal him - he needs exactly 105/126 HP!

> #### Path A
> 
> * Follow strategy X below.

<br/>

> #### Path B & Path C
> 
> * Equip Freya with the Barbut, Mythril Gloves, Plate Mail, and Barette.
> * You can also activate Freya's Chemist ability - if you do, you can use 2 Hi-Potion instead of 3 during the upcoming battle by having Freya throw 1 and another character throw another.
> * Follow strategy Y below.

<br/>

> #### Combined
> 
> * Equip Freya with the Lamia's Tiara, Mythril Gloves, Linen Cuirass, and Pearl Rouge.
> * Follow strategy Y below.

<br/>

> #### Lv 1 Path
> 
> * If you want Zidane to have **ordered** stats, then follow strategy X.
> 
> * If you want Zidane to have **combined** stats, then equip him with the Bandana, Bone Wrist, Survival Vest, and Dark Matter; activate his Antibody ability.
> * Equip Vivi with nothing but the Flame Staff.
> * Follow strategy X below, but instead of using an Ore on Zidane, have Vivi attack him to hopefully deal 18 damage (50% change).

<br/>

> #### Base stats
> 
> * There's no reason for you to skip Tantarian, and you can defeat him any way you like.

* Save your game.

**Target time**: 07:16:46

* Go to the west library on the first floor to challengeâ¦

---

#### Battle: Tantarian [X] (30 AP)

* Have someone use an Ore on Zidane to get his HP to 117, then proceed to spam Lucky Seven!
* 777 and 7,777 are both capable of opening Tantarian, so you've got a 50% chance of doing so.
* Continue firing away with Lucky Seven once Tantarian shows his true form. You'll get 4 to 5 attempts before he closes, after which you should reset. You need to hit him for 7,777 damage 3 times to win.
* The damage you inflict to open him counts just like the damage you do after he opens, so you can end this battle in as few as 3 rounds.
* Remember to knock everyone except Zidane before ending the battle.

---

#### Battle: Tantarian [Y] (30 AP)

* Have someone use an Ore on Zidane to get his HP to 117, then proceed to spam Lucky Seven!
* To win this battle, you'll need to hit for 7,777 three times. Reset the game if Lucky Seven returns anything else during the battle, although you can afford to get 7 up to twice.
* Once you open Tantarian with 7,777 damage, have the other characters use a total of 3 Hi-Potion on the boss while Zidane continue to use Lucky Seven.
* If you hit Tantarian with three strikes of 7,777 damage and heal him with 3 Hi-Potion, he will be left with only 16 HP, or 9 or 2 HP if Lucky Seven returned 7 damage once or twice.
* All that's left then is to have Freya use Jump and Vivi cast a spell on the party to knock everyone out and let Freya absorb all the EXP.

*Thanks to 1whoistornapart for this modified Tantarian strategy*

---

* Run to the top of the castle, using the same path Garnet used earlier.

* After waking up in Lindblum, open the chests, accept Mogki's letter for delivery and save your game (avoid the steps by the closet).

* Attempt to leave the room and choose *How did I get here?* when prompted.
* Go to the royal chamber (you have to talk to either of the 2 guards every time you want to enter the royal chamber, even if you are invited).
* There will be a lot of dialogue once you enter; return to the guest room once it's over.

* Head to the aircab dock after the meeting with Doctor Tot and fly to the Theater District.
* Go to the Tantalus hideout and get the Unusual Potion from Cinna; return to open the chests inside for some Gil.
* Next visit Artist Michael's studio, ask about the potions, then search the studio for the Strange Potion and open the chest for a Lapis Lazuli.
* Return to the aircab terminal and board an aircab for the Business District.
* Deliver Mogki's letter to Moodon at the inn, then head to the market square.
* Proceed down the alley and ask Alice about the potions to receive her Beautiful Potion.
* Enter the synthesis shop to prepare not only another Cotton Robe trick, but also the less-known *Desert Boots trick* :)

| Cotton Robe<br/>Desert Boots | 99<br/>99 | 99,000<br/>29,700 |
| **Gil after** | | 63,760 |

* Hooray for more Gil!

* Ride back to Lindblum Castle and return to the royal chamber.
* Following the upcoming meeting, take the lift to the base level and ride to the Serpent's Gate; open the chest and board the Blue Narciss.

* Form a party with Vivi, Garnet and Quina, then sail west to the island with Chocobo tracks, west of the island with Chocobo's Lagoon.
* Disembark, use Gysahl Greens to call Choco and save your game.

**Target time**: 07:40:46

* Reset, enter Chocobo's Lagoon, dig up a Chocograph, and save on the beach outside. Be sure to save over a different file and check which Chocograph you received after you've already saved; you need either Dawn Lagoon or Disk Plains.
* Play another game of Hot&Cold for the other Chocograph. Back outside, open the Chocograph menu to check whether you got the right one, and take the opportunity to equip Dawn Lagoon.

> #### Path C & Combined
> 
> * You will need to dig up a Chocograph Piece as well!
> * The chances of digging up a Chocograph Piece **and** the right Chocograph in a single 30-second game are quite low, but they are higher in the first game since you have two Chocographs which fit the requirements.
> * If you can't get a good Chocograph and the Chocograph Piece during the first game, then you can try to play 2 consecutive games instead.
> * Playing a second game immediately after another one adds about 0:30.
> 
> **Time**: +0:30

* Don't bother saving after your last game; instead, head straight back to the Blue Narciss and sail to Chocobo's Forest. Use the tracks there to call Choco, then head east and into the water from the last beach - the Dawn Lagoon treasure is to the right of the island nearby.
* Having gotten the Mountain Transformation, return to the beach and climb up the mountain to end up right next to Treno; enter the city.
* Equip Quina with the Needle Fork, Bone Wrist, and Running Shoes; activate his/her Auto-Haste and Add Status abilities.
* Save with Mogrich.

* Save your game once you've finished with this.

**Target time**: 07:49:22

* Afterwards, decide whether or not you want to do the detour for the 10th Promist Ring. If so, then read on. 

> #### The elusive 10th Promist Ring
> 
> * The aim is to win 9 Promist Ring at the Auction House.
> * The Auction House is very random, so arm yourself with patience!
> * Promist Ring appears only in the third slot, and only if there are currently none in your inventory. This means you need to equip each Promist Ring on one character, and switch out characters until all of them have one, and then buy the last one for a total of 9. The 10th is found in the Desert palace.
> * Since you're already bidding here, you may as well pick up the Thief Gloves as well - they will come in handy for upcoming Steals, and you can actually turn a profit by selling it later. This item is listed only in the fourth slot, and only after you've bought the Dark Matter.
> * Keep track of your budget! You should not leave Treno with less than 176,000 Gil, so subtract this from your current Gil total to get your auction allowance!
> * You can spend a bit more money if you make up for it by Stealing some extra items from upcoming bosses. You can get the Power Vest from Ark, a Demon's Vest and Golden Hairpin from Meltigemini, and Mythril Claws from Taharka. But keep in mind this makes those battles harder to get right.
> * Alternatively, you can simply do an extra Cotton Robe trick - if you have the extra time. If so, then buy 99 Wrist from the Dali shop when you're looting the gates in the area, and then drop by the Black Mage Village once you have the Hilda Garde 3 to get Steepled Hat and make the Cotton Robes.
> * Either way, look ahead to make sure that you'll have enough Gil when you reach Oeilvert and Esto Gaza, otherwise you'll have problems.
> * The table below provides an overview of the items up for auction; use the price ranges and average as a guideline for pushing the first two auctions into the final stages as quickly as possible. If you already bought the key items on Disc 2, then avoid them now because you can't sell them a second tome. Reset if the Promist Ring isn't listed.
> 
> | Round | Item | Price range | Average | Selling Value |
> |-------|------|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
> | 1 | Mini-Cid<br/>Griffin's Heart<br/>Rat Tail<br/>Anklet<br/>Magician Robe | 1,500-4,500<br/>3,000-9,000<br/>10,000-30,000<br/>7,500-22,500<br/>3,500-10,500 | 3,000<br/>6,000<br/>20,000<br/>15,000<br/>7,000 | 0<br/>10,000<br/>25,000<br/>1,600<br/>4,000 |
> | 2 | Doga's Artifact<br/>Feather Boots<br/>Fairy Earrings | 4,000-12,000<br/>7,500-22,500<br/>4,000-12,000 | 8,000<br/>15,000<br/>8,000 | 10,000<br/>3,000<br/>3,000 |
> | 3 | Promist Ring | 12,000-36,000 | 24,000 | unique |
> | 4 | Dark Matter<br/>Thief Gloves | 9,400-28,200<br/>13,500-40,500 | 18,800<br/>27,000 | unique<br/>25,000 |
> 
> * Make sure you don't buy the Mini-Cid. Its price range is very narrow, so it's easy to finish at least this first item quickly every time by bidding around 2,000 to 2,400 Gil!
> * As for the Promist Ring, you can either try to get them at the lowest prices you can in order to save Gil and/or create a budget buffer so that you can buy later copies at higher prices; or, you can bid your target price right at the start and hope for a swift finish of the auction.
> * Try to purchase a Promist Ring and the Dark Matter during the first auction. Equip the ring and save. Return and buy another Promist Ring as well as the Thief Gloves, equip the ring, and save again.
> * With those items out of the way, all that's left is to win 3 more Promist Ring, at which point they will stop appearing
> * Then, return to the Blue Narciss. Put Eiko in your party, equip her with the Promist Ring in your inventory, and then reorganize your party again so that you take Steiner, Freya and Amarant.
> * Play a game of Hot&Cold for the Forbidden Forest Chocograph before returning to Treno. If playing **Path C** or **Combined**, see the box below.
> * Win the last 4 Promist Ring - and that's it!
> * The auctions in which you buy 2 items shouldn't take longer than 2:15 on average between consecutive saves. The remaining auctions should be 1:45 or less on average.
> * Don't get too hung up on the exact prices - all that matters is that your overall spend stays within your budget. Don't waste your time trying to get the lowest possible prices, either - it doesn't matter whether you spend all your budget or just half, since there's no use for the extra money anyway. So if it makes the auctions easier and faster, then just bid higher and spend everything you can.
> 
> **Time**: +21:00 **Gil**: -210,000

<br/>

> #### Path C & Combined
> 
> * In addition to the Forbidden Forest Chocograph, you also need to find the Green Plains Chocograph, 2 Chocograph Pieces, and as many Dead Pepper as you can.
> * You'll need exactly 3 Dead Pepper for Pandemonium, and they're also needed to enter Chocobo's Air Garden.
> * As usual, do your best to complete this on only 2 games, and don't save after the second; head straight back to Treno instead and save with Mogrich before you continue buying at the auction.
> * The extra time here is for the second game.
> 
> **Time**: +2:00

* Say goodbye to the Auction House and head over to South Gate.
* Open the chest which you couldn't get at the start of Disc 2 for an Elixir Card, then cross the mountain to reach the South Gate by the river; open the 3 chests there for an Elixir, another Elixir, and 3,206 Gil.
* Next up is North Gate: pick up the Potion and Eye Drops from the Alexandrian side, and then go over to the other side to pick up a Hi-Potion and a Tent.
* Dig up the Forbidden Forest Chocograph on the way there to get 10 Wing Edge and a High Mage Staff

> #### Moguta's Extension
> 
> * Moguta has another unique reward for the first Kupo Nut on this disc as well. Pay him a short visit to get an Extension, if you like.
> * The target times assume you do.
> 
> **Time**: +0:30

<br/>

> #### Path C & Combined
> 
> Head further north and dig up the Green Plains treasure for the Ocean Transformation!
> Don't bother returning to the Blue Narciss; instead, swim across the ocean and go straight to the Black Mage Village.
> 
> **Time**: +1:15

* Return to the Blue Narciss and sail south to the eastern tip of the Outer Continent and disembark on the beach with the Chocobo tracks.
* Call Choco, make your way to the Black Mage Village, and enter.
* Follow Vivi to the cemetery, then go to the Chocobo stable and leave the village after the scenes end.

* Mount Choco and ride to the sinkholes in the east; dismount near the one without any wisps of sand, call Moguo, and finally save your game.

* Choose to take Steiner, Eiko and Amarant with you to Oeilvert, and place Amarant into the top slot.
* Try to reach the airship with no more than 1 battle. Equip Zidane with the Dagger if he doesn't have it.
* You should use this opportunity to raise Zidane's Trance gauge if needed. Simply equip the Sapphire and activate High Tide, then get hit by an Ogre's Flame attack, which cannot knock anyone out.
* If you do get into a battle, knock out Amarant and Eiko before using Flee.

* If you knocked out Eiko and Amarant on the airship dock, then revive Amarant only and do not heal him, and remove all equipment from Eiko and give her an Air Racket instead of the equipment listed below.

* Buy Stiltzkin's latest deal, deliver the letter from Mimoza, and save.

* Return to the foyer and go through the doorway on the left; take the Diamond Sword from the lower chest, examine the holograms in a clockwise manner, loot the chests on the way, then exit the screen through the bottom doorway.
* Open the chest behind the hologram to obtain the Shield Armor; equip it on Steiner!
* Enter the yellow door, run across the walkway, activate the sphere, then return and go through the blue door with the lock.

* Return to the chamber with the moogles and head over to the right side of the chamber to trigger the activation of the star display.
* Save your game after the scene.

**Target time**: 08:31:26

* Pick up the Gaia Gear before descending.

#### Battle: Ark (11 AP)

* Simply have Amarant attack and Steiner use Charge!, then do the same during the second round and the game will be over.
* If Amarant is not in critical HP, have Eiko attack him before Steiner uses Charge!. Or, if you're lucky, Ark will do it for you with Photon.
* Zidane should Steal as often as possible - you need the Holy Lance!

* Remove all equipment from the current party before taking the Gulug Stone from the altar! Give Eiko an Air Racket.

* As Cid, run into the right room in the Desert Palace and retrieve the key from the Hedgehog Pie. The timer in this mini-game will reset, so don't let it stress you; not that you shouldn't reset if you waste 6 minutes hereâ¦
* I've found that the easiest and fastest way to complete this is to press **start** + **circle** + **start** in quick succession. This basically lets you play the game in slow motion and at no time penalty since the game timer stops when the game is paused. You should be able to reach the key within 90 seconds.
* When given options near the scales, choose to put on the weights and pick the last option, *B, C and D*; then climb them to get the key.

* Pick up the letter for Mogsam and save your game.

* Light the candle in the following hallway and extract the Shield Armor from the activated Bloodstone.
* Go onward and up the stairs to find a candelabra; light t in order to illuminate the stained glass on the wall.
* Continue onward to enter a library.

* Go across the room and light the candelabra on the far left; a staircase should appear above the doorway through which you entered.

* Make your way back to the bottom floor of the library, go up the short stairs to the left and light the next candelabra to make the next bookcase rise.
* Enter the doorway and head up the path, lighting both fixtures along the way, then returning to the library once more.
* Light the candelabra on the bottom right side of the library to make the last bookshelf reveal another doorway; enter and light another candelabra.
* Return to the library to find that the left wall has disappeared; go onward to find Mogsam the moogle.
* Battles are very rare in the next area, so you may want to hold off on saving here in order to save some time.

* Continue to the next area to find a gargoyle statue on the wall; light both of the candles beneath it to activate the Bloodstone on the railing.
* Extract the Black Hood from the Bloodstone, then go through the doorway to reach the other side of the room.
* Light all 3 candles on this side, extract the Venetia Shield from the activated Bloodstone, put out the candle in the middle and return to the opposite side of the room.

#### Battle: Valia Pira (11 AP)

* Have Garnet cast Berserk on Freya as soon as possible.
* Open Quina's Blu Mag menu during Garnet's Berserk spell. After the spell connects, exit Quina's menu just long enough for Freya to shift into her attack stance. Then cast Night and sit back until the battle is over.
* If your Freya is Lv 18, then you can be a bit more flexible: 2 attacks from a Berserk Freya will be enough even without the Sleep bonus. Or, you can cast Night twice and attack with Freya after each casting to get the same effect.
* Everyone except Vivi must survive this battle to gain AP. Have him distribute Phoenix Down as necessary in case Valia Pira manages to attack.
* It's possible to replace Quina with Vivi and use his Sleep spell. But cross your fingers that it connects.

* Light the last candelabra after the battle, unequip Garnet's and Quina's gear, and save your game again with Mogsam.

**Target time**: 08:45:45

* Return to where you fought Valia Pira and use the now-active teleporter to continue onward.
* Equip Zidane with the Dagger before making your way to the teleporter.
* Enter Kuja's chamber, and choose Amarant, Freya, and Vivi when prompted to form a party.

* **Don't forget the Namingway card after forming your new party; this is the last one in the game!**

> #### Arrow manipulation
> 
> * If you want your Namingway card to have a specific arrow arrangement, you can use the following trick, courtesy of Vizuino:
> 
> * Reset your console and load a save in Treno. Go to the card stadium and purchase cards one at a time, noting down which arrows they come with. Count how many cards you bought to get one with your desired arrow arrangement.
> * Reset the console and reload the save.
> * Buy all those cards again, except for the last one with the desired arrow arrangement. You'll notice that you get exactly the same cards.
> * Now do a **soft** reset, load your save in the Desert Palace, and pick up your Namingway card - it should have the arrows of the last card you didn't buy.

* Take the teleporter and exit the Desert Palace through the airship dock. 
* Follow the same instructions as before if you still need to raise Zidane's Trance gauge.

* You will get another opportunity to arrange your party before disembarking on the Lost Continent, but don't make any changes.
* Run a bit towards Esto Gaza, then call Moguo and finally save your game.

> #### Path A, B & Lv 1
> 
> * If you have the time to spare (especially if you skipped the Promist Ring detour), then you can make the following area much easier.
> * Enter Esto Gaza and proceed as normal, but return to the world map after the scenes are over.
> * Equip Amarant with the Kaiser Knuckles, Green Beret, Bone Wrist, Power Vest, and Rebirth Ring; activate Auto-Life and Bird Killer.
> * Remove the others' armor so that they can knock themselves out.
> 
> * Save near the beach, then encounter a Whale Zombie.
> * Hopefully it will open with Fin. Knock out everyone except Amarant, and hope for Zombie Powder. Attack once to finish the battle.
> 
> * Replace Amarant's Rebirth Ring with the Black Belt. Once you find the Red Hat in Mountain Gulug, equip that as well and activate MP Attack. 
> * Revive Freya without healing her, and activate her Cover ability. You can equip the Linen Cuirass if necessary.
> * Ignore the upcoming equipment changes before the Red Dragon battles.
> 
> * With this set-up, you can easily get past the upcoming Red Dragon battles. Amarant can take them out in one hit each, so hope he gets a turn at the start of the battle and have him attack immediately.
> * The remaining Red Dragon then has a 1 in 3 change of using Dive. This will always hit and knock out Freya thanks to the Cover ability, and Amarant can attack again for the win.
> 
> * You can make up the missed AP gains by finding the Friendly Feather Circle near the Chocobo tracks and giving it a Moonstone.

* Enter Esto Gaza and watch the scenes.
* Before going on to Mount Gulug, head right to find the equipment shop and make the following purchases:

| Items bought | Quantity | Gil |

| **Gil after** | | 31,103 |

* There are other missable items up for sale here, but you can buy them later once you have more Gil at your disposal.

* Equip your party as indicated below, then return to the lobby and go through the doorway in the back.

| Zidane | Vivi | Freya | Amarant |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| Exploda<br/>Black Hood<br/>Thief Gloves<br/>Chain Plate<br/>Lapis Lazuli | Oak Staff<br/>-<br/>Magic Armlet<br/>Silk Robe<br/>Running Shoes | Heavy Lance<br/>Cross Helm<br/>Thunder Gloves<br/>Shield Armor<br/>Lapis Lazuli | Scissor Fangs<br/>-<br/>Jade Armlet<br/>Brigandine<br/>Power Belt |

* Read the letter Mogrika received, accept her letter to Moolan and save your game.

* Go down the stairs to the right and through the door to enter Mount Gulug.
* Enter the building on the left, pick up the Gil and Ether, and then exit through the hole on the upper level.
* Climb down the ladder, pick up the Red Hat, equip it on Amarant, and then return to the entrance of the area.
* Go into the house on the right and go through it to reach a hanging rope; go past it and jump onto the walkway to the right.
* Continue along the path to find a chest with a Golden Hairpin. Equip it on Vivi, then return to the rope and slide down; pull the lever down 3 times to disembark.
* Take the right walkway to reach another building; pick up the Wing Edge in the corner.
* Deliver Mogrika's letter, accept the letter to Mogtaka and save your game.

**Target time**: 08:57:34

* Exit the house through the right hole and make your way to the Gaia Gear at the end of the path. Having picked it up, backtrack to get ambushed byâ¦

---

#### Battle: Red Dragon x 2 (3 AP)

* This is the most annoying of the forced Red Dragon battles, so come armed with patience.
* Cast Stop and attack with Freya and Amarant to Stop, Petrify or Venom them in any combination.
* Don't attack the same Red Dragon twice until you know whether the first attack connected - open a menu the moment someone's attack animation begins and wait for the result. This also keeps the enemies' ATB gauges from filling while you wait.
* Keep Zidane on stand-by to throw Phoenix Down in case Dive connects, and make sure everyone except Vivi survives the battle to gain AP.

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Zidane | Accuracy+<br/>Master Thief<br/>Devil Killer<br/>Ability Up<br/>Sacrifice<br/>Lucky Seven | 12/30<br/>28/50<br/>\* \* \*<br/>64/95<br/>37/55<br/>37/85 |
| Freya | Accuracy+<br/>Distract<br/>Devil Killer | 6/30<br/>6/25<br/>12/30 |
| Amarant | MP Attack | 36/60 |

---

* Dash back to Moolan and **save your game**!

**Target time**: 08:59:17

* Reload and slide down the rope to the bottom of the pit, then move towards the bottom of the screen to trigger the next battle.

---

#### Battle: Red Dragon x 2 (3 AP)

* Use the  same strategy as before. At least this time you don't have to worry about random battles on the way, and the attempts are shorter. The next and last Red Dragon is easy, so this is it!
* Again, make sure everyone besides Vivi survives.

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Zidane | Accuracy+<br/>Master Thief<br/>Ability Up<br/>Sacrifice<br/>Lucky Seven | 24/30<br/>34/50<br/>70/95<br/>43/55<br/>43/85 |

| Amarant | MP Attack | 48/60 |

---

* Climb back up the rope after the battle, and continue along the path to the left of the well.
* Enter the building on the left; pick up the Demon's Mail and then enter the other door outside.
* Say hi to Mogtaka, deliver the letter from Moolan, and save your game again.

**Target time**: 09:00:58

* Take the stairs, enter the building and head toward the chest to trigger the last and easiest of these Red Dragon battles.

---

#### Battle: Red Dragon (3 AP)

* There's only a single Red Dragon this time, and it couldn't really be any closer to the save point, so it shouldn't take all that long to get past this last battle.

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Zidane | Accuracy+<br/>Master Thief<br/>Ability Up<br/>Sacrifice<br/>Lucky Seven | \* \* \*<br/>40/50<br/>76/95<br/>49/55<br/>49/85 |
| Freya | Accuracy+<br/>Distract<br/>Devil Killer | 18/30<br/>18/25<br/>\* \* \* |
| Amarant | MP Attack | \* \* \* |

---

* Open the chest in the back for an Elixir, then return to Mogtaka.
* Make sure that Freya and Amarant are both in the front row, then remove all of Vivi's gear and make the following changes to the others' equipment:

| Zidane | Vivi | Freya | Amarant |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| Exploda<br/>Red Hat<br/>Thief Gloves<br/>Brigandine<br/>Reflect Ring | Flame Staff<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>- | Holy Lance<br/>Mythril Helm<br/>Diamond Gloves<br/>Shield Armor<br/>Power Belt | Kaiser Knuckles<br/>Green Beret<br/>Jade Armlet<br/>Chain Plate<br/>Black Belt |
| MP Attack<br/>Devil Killer<br/>Ability Up<br/>Antibody | | MP Attack<br/>Devil Killer<br/>Ability Up<br/>Antibody | MP Attack<br/>Devil Killer<br/>Ability Up |

* If you have extra Magic Stones, activate Distract as well.
* Return to Mogtaka and save your game.

**Target time**: 09:02:36

* Go back to the rope, slide down and go through the gap in the wall.

---

#### Battle: Meltigemini (11 AP)

* Two hits from Freya and one or two hits from Amarant will be enough to end this battle.
* Keep Vivi on stand-by to distribute Phoenix Down.
* Zidane can either do the same, or you can have him Steal some gear for selling later. Enter an attack command at the end of the second round in case Freya and Amarant don't finish the job.
* Everyone except Vivi needs to survive the battle to get AP.

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Zidane | Auto-Reflect<br/>MP Attack<br/>Master Thief<br/>Ability Up<br/>Sacrifice<br/>Lucky Seven | 75/95<br/>40/45<br/>\* \* \*<br/>\* \* \*<br/>\* \* \*<br/>71/85 |
| Freya | Distract<br/>Insomniac | \* \* \*<br/>\* \* \* |
| Amarant | Devil Killer | \* \* \* |

---

* A few scenes will commence after the battle and you will wake up to find yourself in the Lindblum Castle Guest Room once again.
* Pick up the letter to Kumool and save your game.

**Target time**: 09:12:20 (+19:52) **Target Gil**: 47,224 **Encounters**: 0

<table>
<tr>

* Head straight to the conference room to initiate a long sequence of scenes.

* You will eventually gain control of the Hilda Garde 3; immediately press **circle** to dock in Lindblum. Also, place Steiner, Freya and Amarant in your party when prompted to create a new one.
* Tell Erin that you want to board the airship and go to the bridge; then go down the ladder and check the area for an Elixir and a Tent.
* Exit and board the airship once more, but this time go to the world map.

* Land near Pinnacle Rocks and open the 2 chests there for a Phoenix Down and an Elixir.

* Next fly over to Treno. Make sure Amarant still has the Kaiser Knuckles and Black Belt equipped, and the MP Attack and Bird Killer abilities activated. If following **combined**, skip this part for now and read the box below.
* You may want to save your game at this point.
* Challenge Amdusias with Amarant; a single swipe with the Kaiser Knuckles is all it takes to win the prized Running Shoes!
* Remove everyone's equipment after the battle and leave the city.

> #### Path C
> 
> * Ipsen's Castle will have to wait - there's more digging to be done!
> 
> * If you want BAL Quina, then disregard this detour and instead follow the one for **combined** below.
> 
> * Fly east to the Chocobo tracks in the Salvage Archipelago, call Choco and save your game.
> * You need to dig up the Ocean Chocograph, as well as the final 2 Chocograph Pieces. Try to do this within 2 games, like in the Forest.
> * Don't leave Chocobo's Lagoon until you have at the very least 1 Dead Pepper, you will need it shortly!
> * Save on the beach closer to Chocobo's Lagoon after the first game.
> * The next 2 Chocographs are very difficult to locate consistently, so after the second game, you may want to save your game on the southern stretch of beach to the east of the Ocean Chocograph treasure.
> 
> **Target time**: 09:34:26
> 
> * Either way, head northwest to dig the Ocean Chocograph, then continue northwest to reach the northeastern tip of the Mist Continent.
> * Dig up the Mist Ocean Chocograph for the Sky Transformation.
> * Afterwards, swim north to the long peninsula on the Outer Continent and save your game in one of the forests there.
> 
> * Load and reset until you have a shadow appears on Kuentis peninsula just a bit to the south, then use a Dead Pepper when positioned above the shadow to reach Chocobo's Air Garden.
> * All you need to do here is find the Fairy Island Chocograph and be on your merry way!
> * If you have the time to spare, then you may want to consider digging up the Forgotten Island Chocograph as well. This gets you a second Rebirth Ring, which can make the Pandemonium battles a bit easier. However, you'll have to play an extra game at the Air Garden, and dig up an extra Chocograph, so make sure you have the extra time. This is not included in the target times.
> * Make sure you have 3 Dead Pepper in your inventory at the end! It's not absolutely necessary, but Pandemonium will be easier with them. Sell any extras if necessary.
> 
> * Make a stop-over on Vile Island to dig up the Fairy Island Chocograph.
> * Dig up the Forgotten Island Chocograph as well if you're going for it.
> 
> **Time**: +11:00

<br/>

> #### Combined
> 
> * Ipsen's Castle will have to wait - there's more digging to be done!
> 
> * Make a pit-stop at Chocobo's Forest before heading to Treno; you need to find the last 2 Chocograph Pieces, and a ton of Dead Pepper.
> * You'll have to play two games, so try to make the most out if it by maybe finding all 8 treasures and getting a nice limit bonus. It will save you plenty of frustration soon enough.
> * At the very least, try to find 2 Dead Pepper per game. This will also reduce potential frustration during the next part.
> 
> * Once you've done that, don't save after the second game and ride Choco to Treno; save with Mogrich.
> * You need to acquire the Dark Matter from the Auction House if you do not already have it.
> * Defeat Amdusias and claim your Running Shoes as described earlier.
> * If you want to save some time, become **very** familiar with the location of the Mist Ocean Chocograph and don't bother saving after the weapon shop battle.
> 
> * Either way, exit Treno and find the Mist Ocean Chocograph to finally get the Sky Transformation!
> 
> * Afterwards, swim north to the long peninsula on the Outer Continent and use the forest there to become airborne.
> * Fly just a bit south to Kuentis Peninsula and land again. Dismount Choco, make sure you're facing southeast and standing with Choco in a forest, then finally save your game.
> * From this location, you can just load and reset until a shadow appear on the peninsula: that's Chocobo's Air Garden, your next destination.
> * To reach it, you need to mount Choco, fly up, and use a Dead Pepper wile above the shadow. This is why your Dead Pepper inventory is so critical!
> 
> * It's finally time to claim that elusive Robe of Lords, but you will need a grand total of 10,000 Chocobo Hot&Cold points to get it.
> 
> * You will have to reset until you manage to dig up all 8 items with a limit bonus of at least 1,000 points. Then repeat until you have the requisite 10,000 as well as the Fairy Island Chocograph.
> * Since your Beak Lv will still be rather low at the beginning, you may not get very high scores, but you should try to get higher ones as your Beak Lv rises.
> * Depending on how many points you've already collected, and on how big your limit bonuses will be here, you will need between 8 to 10 games at 1,000+ points per game.
> 
> * You'll most likely find the Forgotten Island Chocograph as well. The treasure includes another Rebirth Ring which may make your battles in Pandemonium a bit easier, but you'll need to spend some extra time finding it and digging it up - the target times don't include this since it's not essential, but if you have the time then go for it.
> 
> * Keep an eye on your Dead Pepper inventory. Since you need to dig up 8 treasures in order to get the limit bonus, chances are you'll find at least 1 Dead Pepper for your next trip. But if you run out of them at some point and don't find another one during your last game, then you will have to reset, no matter how good the limit bonus was.
> * Make sure you have 3 Dead Pepper in your inventory at the end! It's not absolutely necessary, but Pandemonium will be easier with them. Sell any extras if necessary.
> 
> * Make a stop-over on Vile Island to dig up the Fairy Island Chocograph.
> * If you've decided to pick up the second Rebirth Ring, then dig up the Forgotten Island Chocograph as well.
> 
> **Good luck!**
> 
> **Time**: +26:00

* Fly across the ocean to Ipsen's Castle; save outside.

* Take Steiner, Freya and Quina with you, and equip the party as follow:

| Zidane | Steiner | Freya | Quina |

* Enter the next door, climb down the ladder and climb all the way up the next one.
* Enter the doorway, then take the lift.
* Take all 4 mirrors, then go down the steps to fightâ¦

#### Battle: Taharka

* Simply have Steiner attack and inflict Heat on Taharka, which will promptly end the battle. The Flame Saber has a 10% chance of causing Heat.
* Everyone except Quina needs to survive this battle for AP, so have Freya or Quina throw Phoenix Down if necessary. If you are aiming for **combined** stats, then Quina needs to survive as well.
* Zidane should Steal the Orichalcon.

**Target time**: 09:32:21

* Go back and get Amarant from the chamber below the courtyard.
* Leave Ipsen's Castle.

* When given the option to form a party, choose Steiner, Vivi and Quina.
* Fly to the Water Shrine, the Fire Shrine, and then north-northwest to land just outside Daguerreo; call Moguo and save your game at the entrance.

**Target time**: 09:36:51

* Enter Daguerreo and go left.
* Examine the 3 levers in the bookshelf and pull the left one twice.
* Examine the hole by the leftmost lift, then take the stick by the bookshelf and place it into the hole.
* Pull the right lever twice and board the lift to reach the equipment shop!

* You don't need to buy the Zorlin Shape yet if you don't have the money - you'll have more soon and can buy the swords on Terra.
* You can sell any other items which Zidane may have stolen from bosses and which were not specifically mentioned. Do a Ctrl+F search to make sure everything you sell will no longer be needed.

* Place Zidane in the front row and equip Quina as follows:

| Zidane | Quina |
|--------|-------|
| Orichalcon<br/>Green Beret<br/>Bone Wrist<br/>Power Vest<br/>Power Belt | Silver Fork<br/>Bandana<br/>N-Kai Armlet<br/>-<br/>Yellow Scarf |
| Distract<br/>MP Attack<br/>Devil Killer<br/>Insomniac | Millionaire<br/>Insomniac |

* Leave the town and save your game.

**Target time**: 09:39:20

> #### Path C
> 
> * If Zidane is still not reliably 1 hit away from Trance, then consider following the Trance strategy in the box below. You need him to be as close to Trance as possible for the Shell Dragon battle.

<br/>

> #### Combined
> 
> * Don't save or equip anyone just yet - head to the Wind Shrine, then turn the ship around and fly northwest to the northern tip of Everlang Island, the longest island in the Salvage Archipelago.
> * Equip Quina with the Silver Fork, Holy Miter, N-Kai Armlet, Robe of Lords, and Ribbon; activate his/her Level Up and Antibody abilities.
> * Remove Zidane's equipment and deactivate his Distract ability.
> * Save your game.
> 
> * This is your last chance to fill Zidane's Trance gauge. Equip the Power Vest and put him in the back row so that he survives Whale Zombie's Fin attack, and proceed with the instructions below. Do some testing to see how likely it is for Zidane to enter Trance from just 1 hit. It will be the same for Shell Dragon. If your gauge is at 80% or more, then you can get as close as 254/255 with the next 2 battles, which is practically guaranteed Trance upon contact.
> 
> * Encounter a Whale Zombie on the beach: have Zidane throw a Phoenix Down and Quina Eat the monster once Zidane is knocked out (either by the Whale Zombie or by himself) to learn Lv5 Death and gain 9,913 EXP.
> * Save if you wish, then hunt down another Whale Zombie and defeat it with an Elixir.
> * Save your game again.
> 
> * Now comes the fun part: run onto the grass and get ready to slay some **Grand Dragons**!
> * You'll need to defeat 5, and Lv5 Death makes short work on them.
> * Save between battles if you like, but you should try to get 2 or more battles per save after the second battle once Quina is stronger; use an Elixir at that point to replenish HP and MP.
> * Once you've defeated 5 Grand Dragons, **deactivate** the Level Up ability and defeat 1 more Grand Dragon.
> * If you've done everything correctly, Quina should be at Lv 45 with 319,094 EXP.
> 
> * Revive Zidane and equip him and Quina as indicated earlier.

* Drop off Steiner and Vivi at the Wind Shrine, then finally fly to the Earth Shrine and enter. Dodge the sliding walls and challenge:

---

#### Earth Guardian (11 AP)

* Have Zidane attack, then Quina cast Night, in that order.
* Zidane should get another turn before the Night animation is over; have him Steal either the Rubber Suit or the Avenger.
* Wait for Zidane's ATB gauge to fill, then use a regular attack and keep the X button pressed to command Quina to use Night immediately afterwards.
* Repeat this one more time to Steal the other item, except have Quina Eat the boss rather than cast Night a third time.
* You need to Steal both the Rubber Suit and the Avenger, because you need the 18,000 Gil you receive from selling them.
* If Zidane is at Lv 1, then there is a slight chance that he won't do enough damage for Quina to Eat the boss. Reset and try again if this happens.

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Zidane | MP Attack | \* \* \* |
| Quina | Insomniac | \* \* \* |

* Add Steiner and Garnet to your party when prompted, then turn ever so slightly to the right with your airship and fly to the grass at the coast of the Forgotten Continent.
* Land, then save your game.

### Bran Bal &rarr; Pandemonium Hall

* Go to the entrance of Bran Bal and through the yellow-green force field.
* After a brief scene, go onward and speak to the girl.

* As Zidane, follow Garland through Pandemonium from platform to platform.
* You will eventually face 3 consecutive battles in which your party will have to absorb 3 doses of unavoidable EXP, as per the following table:

| Stats path | Amdusias | Abadon | Shell Dragon |
|------------|:--------:|:------:|:------------:|
| **Path A** | Freya | Zidane | Garnet |
| **Path B** | Freya | Zidane | Garnet |
| **Path C** | Freya | Quina | Garnet |
| **Combined** | Freya | Quina | Garnet |
| **Lv 1 Path** | Zidane | Zidane | Zidane |

---

#### Battle: Amdusias (3 AP)

* The fight with Amdusias consists of 3 stages: the first stage lasts until Amdusias flies into the air, at which point it is fully healed and Freya shows up. The second stage ends when Amdusias's HP is reduced below half. At this final stage, its HP is restored back up to half (5,463), and Amarant shows up.
* Amdusias always begins by casting Bio, but Zidane will be protected thanks to Auto-Reflect or Auto-Life.

**Path A/Lv 1/Combined**

* Wait until Freya shows up, then have Zidane attack, followed by Freya.
* This will cause Amarant to appear; make Zidane attack again, then wait for Amdusias's action.
* Knock out Zidane and Amarant, then have Freya attack for the win. Or have Zidane attack instead if following the Lv 1 Path.

**Path B/C**

* With the Holy Lance and Mythril Helm, Freya is strong enough to take out Amdusias by herself.
* Wait until she shows up, then have her attack once to trigger Amarant.
* Wait for Amdusias to make a move, then knock out Zidane and Amarant, and have Freya attack again for the win.

---

#### Battle: Abadon (4 AP)

* Your success in this battle rests on Abadon's first attack, for the most part: you've pretty much won the fight if it doesn't knock out Quina.
* The main idea is to get Quina knocked out by Abadon's second attack in order to get revived with 1 HP, in prime condition for Limit Glove abuse. Therefore, have Steiner knock himself out if he isn't knocked out in the first round to force this trategy in the second.
* If Quina is knocked out by the first attack, then your only hope is Quina not getting targeted again in the second round.
* Zidane will join the battle after Abadon's second attack.

**Path A/B/Lv 1**

* Have Zidane Defend and Quina use Limit Glove as soon as possible; you are almost guaranteed to be able to do this before the third attack.
* Wait for Abadon's third attack, then have Quina knock him/herself out and Zidane attack to win the battle and absorb the EXP..

**Path C/Combined**

* Have Zidane attack once, and then get him knocked out so that Quina can cast Limit Glove for the win.
* If Quina is at Lv 45, then you may need to knock him/her out yourself before being able to use Limit Glove, due to the higher HP and stats.

---

#### Battle: Shell Dragon (4 AP)

* This battle consists of two stages: during the first, Zidane is alone. Once his HP hits critical levels, Garnet joins the battle and Shell Dragon's HP is restored back to 10,921.
* Shell Dragon's attacks are chosen randomly. Smash reduces a target's HP to 1 (useful for the trigger above), Earth Shake deals Earth-based damage to all, and Charge is a strong physical attack on all.

**Path A/B**

* Immediately transfer Zidane to the Back Row and wait for Smash. After Garnet appears, have Zidane attack once **before** he enters Trance.
* Do the following depending on the damage:

| Damage done | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| 936 | Have someone throw an Amethyst on Shell Dragon. Use Solution 9, knock out Zidane and attack with Garnet. |
| 988 | Same, but throw a Peridot, Sapphire, or Topaz. Any will work. |
| 1,040 | Same, but throw a Potion to restore 150 HP instead. |
| 1,092 | Same, but throw a Lapis Lazuli. You should be in possession of 2 pieces, allowing it to heal for 200 HP. |
| 1,144 | Throw a Lapis Lazuli to restore 200 HP. After Shell Dragon's attack, have Garnet throw an Aquamarine, Peridot, or Sapphire **before** using Solution 9. Knock out Zidane and attack with Garnet for the win. |
| 1,196 | Same, but throw 2 potions instead. |

**Path C/Combined**

* You need Zidane to fall to critical HP as soon as possible.
* If he has the Auto-Life ability, then you have nothing to worry about. Simply wait for Shell Dragon's attack and let Smash or Charge do it for you, or use a Dead Pepper on Zidane if he absorbs Earth Shake.
* If you have Auto-Reflect, then it's basically the same, except that Charge will result in a Game Over.
* You need exactly 3 Dead Pepper for them to give the desired effect.

* Either way, Zidane should Trance after getting targeted by Smash.
* Use Meo Twister - it will deal either 5,214, 5,372, or 5,688 damage.
* Throw a Lapis Lazuli if the damage is not 5,214 to heal Shell Dragon.
* Transfer Garnet to the back row if you get the chance.
* Have Garnet use an Elixir on Zidane and then use Meo Twister a second time and cross your fingers.
* Overall, there is only a 1/9 chance that you'll deal too much damage, namely if you get 5,688 damage twice. There is a 2/9 chance that the monster will be left with only 59 HP, and the remaining 6/9 leave it with 219 to 535 HP for garnet to tear through with her racket.

* Knock out Zidane before dealing the finishing blow, and make sure he has used up his Auto-Life, if he had it activated!

**Lv 1 Path**

* Simply use Solution 9 and one attack from Zidane to win. Or just keep attacking normally and healing whenever needed.

---

* Your party is finally reunited after the third battle.
* Unequip Garnet, then give Zidane the Rebirth Ring and activate his Auto-Life ability, and give Quina a Bandana and Running Shoes and activate his/her Auto-Haste and Insomniac abilities. Revive Zidane and keep him in critical status.
* Head back along the corridor and form a party with Zidane, Steiner, Freya and Amarant, then backtrack one more screen to find Moorock.
* His Mogshop is the same as before, so purchase the Defender if you couldn't afford it before, then finally **save**!

**Target time**: 10:10:47 (+14:20) **Target Gil**: - **Encounters**: 0

    <td>Elixir</td>
    <td>Holy Miter</td>
    <td>Carabini Mail</td>
    <td>Battle Boots</td>
    <td>20,007 Gil</td>
</tr>
</table>

* You'll likely enter at least 1 battle before you reach the next save point.
* Have everyone beside Zidane knock themselves out before you use Flee, then revive them after the battle.
* Do **not** heal anyone at all during this process; the point of this is to get the entire party to critical HP!

* Go back a screen and search the throne for a Holy Miter.
* Now go onward until you reach a room with many columns. Press the switch at the top and make your way between the columns, taking care not to pass by a lighted one. The sequence of changing lights is always identical, so try to memorize a path through this room.
* Cross the light-bridge and approach the machine; set it to height 3, then continue into the next room.
* Run around the path to the higher dock and board the lift, then run up again and board from the dock to the right to be taken to a chest with 20,007 Gil inside.
* Return to the control panel and set it to 4, then take the lift from the dock closest to the entrance.
* Climb all the way up and board from the leftmost dock to be taken to the next floor.

* From the center, head to the right and take the pink teleporter.
* In the maze, take the 2 blue teleporters on either side of the pink one to be taken to 2 paths, each leading to a chest; the teleporter to the right takes you to an Elixir, while the teleporter on the far left takes you to a Carabini Mail.
* Return and take the pink teleporter back to the floor below.
* Now take the leftmost pink teleporter; take the path which branches off to the right to reach a chest containing Battle Boots.
* Go back and take the path to the next blue teleporter which will eventually bring you to Mozme's platform.

Place everyone in the front row, make sure they're all at critical HP, and equip then as follows before moving on:

| Zidane | Steiner | Freya | Amarant |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| Orichalcon<br/>Green Beret<br/>Egoist's Armlet<br/>Judo Uniform<br/>Ribbon | Coral Sword<br/>Cross Helm<br/>Thunder Gloves<br/>Chain Mail<br/>Power Belt | Holy Lance<br/>Mythril Helm<br/>Venetia Shield<br/>Minerva's Plate<br/>Barette | Kaiser Knuckles<br/>Bandana<br/>Bone Wrist<br/>Power Vest<br/>Black Belt |
| MP Attack<br/>Bird Killer<br/>Man Eater<br/>Distract | MP Attack<br/>Bird Killer<br/>Man Eater<br/>Distract | MP Attack<br/>Bird Killer<br/>Man Eater<br/>Distract | MP Attack<br/>Bird Killer<br/>Man Eater |

* Deliver the letter from Moorock and save your game.

**Target time**: 10:17:35

---

#### Battle: Silver Dragon (13 AP)

* Simply have Steiner use Charge! and regular physical attacks from the others to wipe the floor with this boss in just a few seconds.

| Character | Ability | AP points |
|-----------|---------|:---------:|
| Steiner | Charge! | \* \* \* |

---

#### Battle: Garland (0 AP)

* Just use Charge!, and physical attacks from Freya and Amarant to end this battle in 2 rounds. Keep Zidane on standby until Garland acts.
* Have Zidane distribute Phoenix Down to anyone who gets knocked out. If Zidane himself gets knocked out, have Amarant revive him instead.
* Try to have someone throw Steiner an Elixir before the next battle.

---

#### Battle: Kuja (0 AP)

* A very anti-climactic battle; use the same strategy as for Garland.

---

* Run down the path and across the bridge to the teleporter between the eyes.
* Activate everyone's Insomniac abilities after the battles - deactivate Distract or Man Eater if necessary.
* Enter Bran Bal and wait to save.

**Target time**: 10:28:25 (+17:38) **Target Gil**: 0 **Encounters** 0

## Disc 4 - Congratulations! You've finished Disc 3!

### Start of Disc 4 &rarr; Memoria Entrance

> #### The Nero Family side-quest (1/3)
> 
> * Only recently discovered, this obscure side-quest has you flying back and forth all the way to the Tantalus hideout in Lindblum every few steps you take in Memoria. Your reward is a Protect Ring.
> * It is visible whether you completed the side-quest because you get the item from a chest which appears in the hideout once the side-quest is finished.
> * Interestingly, this side-quest loops over once you complete it, and there are actually enough progression points in the game to do it a second time. However, due to the time constraints, you will only go back the minimum number of times so that the progression points after the Excalibur II will be exactly enough to finish the side-quest once.
> 
> * Fly to Lindblum and go to the Tantalus hideout to start the sequence.
> * Entering through the main gate is faster than using the airship dock.
> 
> **Time**: +2:30

* If you're doing the Neo Family side-quest, then save your game next to the airship outside Lindblum. If not, then save at the base of the Iifa Tree, unless you want to reload from the start of the disc.

---

#### Battle: Nova Dragon (13 AP)

* You've basically won this battle if you get the chance to cast Night.
* Make everyone who acts before Quina attack, then cast Night and wait for everyone's ATB gauges to refill.
* Enter all your commands in rapid succession and make sure that you select Night as the last command and just before Nova wakes up from getting hit.
* Freya (or Zidane if he's stronger) should be the first to attack when Nova Dragon is asleep to best advantage of the multiplier for attacking a sleeping target.
* Have Zidane act as medic when necessary.
* Run up the brick path and immediately use the blue glyph to exit Memoria, forming a party with Zidane, Steiner, Freya and Amarant.

> #### The Nero Family side-quest (2/3)
> 
> * Return to Lindblum to trigger the second part of the Nero Family side-quest, then return to Memoria and save at the colorful orb.
> 
> **Time**: +2:40

**Target time**: 10:40:40 (+12:15) **Target Gil**: - **Encounters**: 0

### The Fire Chaos: Maliris

<table>
<tr>
    <td>The Tower</td>
</tr>
</table>

* If you have a battle on your way up the tower, use it to get everyone to critical HP as in Pandemonium - then use Charge! in the upcoming battle, though it's not essential.

* Don't bother picking up and equipping Freya with the Kain's Lance; the Holy Lance is stronger if she also has the Mythril Helm equipped, as she should.
* Head onward and pick up The Tower; equip it on Zidane and give him the Rebirth Ring; activate Auto-Life and Bandit. Also equip Steiner with the Defender.
* Swap out everyone's Man Eater, Bird Killer and Insomniac abilities for Devil Killer and whatever else they may need; activate Body Temp on anyone who may have access to it.
* Administer Ether and Phoenix Down if needed.

---

#### Battle: Maliris (10 AP)

* **Do not end this battle until you have stolen the Genji Armor**!!!
* Normal attacks from Amarant and Freya will make short work of Maliris.
* Use Charge! if the party is in critical status.
* Have Zidane act as medic when not busy using Steal.
* Maliris will use Raining Swords at the end of the battle; make sure Zidane still has Auto-Life at this point, or have Freya Jump just before dealing the finishing blow.

---

* Equip Steiner with the Ultima Sword if you happened to Steal it.
* Revive the party and use an Ether on whomever needs one, but **do not** restore anyone's HP!
* Activate Freya's Dragon Killer ability.
* Save your game by using the secret save point on the right side of the little balcony overlooking Alexandria Castle.

**Target time**: 10:45:01

> #### The Nero Family side-quest (3/3)
> 
> * You guessed it - run all the way back to the entrance of Memoria and fly to the hideout to trigger the next sequence, then return and save at the colorful orb.
> * When forming a party upon exiting, choose anyone because you'll be doing this several times anyway.
> 
> * After returning for the first time, keep going through Memoria until you reach the screen with the storm - Zidane will comment on it, and that's your cue to return to Lindblum. Save at the secret save point before trekking back to the entrance.
> 
> * Once you get back, save again at the colorful orb, and then once more at the secret save point. Continue onward to the area with the storm until Zidane and Garnet make some comments above the boat - time to fly back yet again. Save at the secret save point before heading down.
> * Luckily this is the final sequence you need to do under the 12-hour time limit, so be sure to form your party with Zidane, Freya and Amarant before you leave.
> * As usual, save at the colorful orb once you return from Lindblum, and then again at the secret save point before moving on to Tiamat.
> 
> * You can complete the remaining parts of the side-quest after you get the Excalibur II. Do **not** continue past Lich's chamber before that. Consult the Leftovers section for more details as to how to proceed.
> 
> **Time**: +16:15

**Target time**: 11:01:10 (+20:30) **Target Gil**: - **Encounters**: 4

### The Wind Chaos: Tiamat

<table>
<tr>
    <td>Rune Claws</td>
</tr>
</table>

* Continue onward until you reach a screen with the *eye* of the Invincible; grab the Rune Claws off to the side and equip them on Amarant.
* Go up the stairs to initiate the next boss battle.

---

#### Battle: Tiamat (10 AP)

* **Do not end this battle until you have stolen the Blood Sword**!!!
* The tactics for this battle are identical to those used for Maliris, except for the counter-attack at the end.
* Be sure to make greater use of Charge! since the entire party is now in critical status.

---

* Head into the next screen, where you can find another secret save point about halfway up the stairs and to the right, just below a lamp; save your game.

**Target time**: 11:04:29

* Revive the party and once again use Ether on anyone low on MP.
* It's possible to make it to the next save point without a battle, but very unlikely - use Flee as soon as possible if you get one.
* Reactivate everyone's Distract, Devil Killer and Body Temp abilities.
* Equip Steiner with your newly acquired Genji Armor for Body Temp, give him and Freya some Diamond Gloves, and Zidane a Ribbon.

* Save at the colorful orb before the waterfall.

**Target time**: 11:06:12 (+5:02) **Target Gil**: - **Encounters**: 1

### The Water Chaos: Kraken

* Walk under the waterfall and up the steps until you get ambushed byâ¦

---

#### Battle: Kraken (10 AP)

* **Do not end this battle until you have stolen the Genji Helmet**!!!
* Before attacking Kraken directly, have Freya attack one Tentacle, and Zidane and Amarant the other. The latter should be eliminated, but keep the other one alive for now to lower the odds of Kraken using a Waterga counter.
* Have Zidane Steal the Genji Helmet and the others attack Kraken's body, then begin using Charge! to end the battle within two rounds.

---

* Administer Phoenix Down and Ether as needed.
* Continue up the stairs and across the wires to a secret save point in the right corner of the screen.

**Target time**: 11:10:59 (+4:47) **Target Gil**: - **Encounters**: 0

### The Earth Chaos: Lich

* Simply run to the door and climb the ladders to reach Lich's chamber.

---

#### Battle: Lich (10 AP)

* **Do not end this battle until you have stolen the Genji Gloves**!!!
* The almighty Charge! rips Lich to shreds, especially with Freya and Amarant dealing ridiculous damage with simple physical attacks thanks to Lich's weakness to Holy **and** Wind.
* An extremely disappointing final battle for this **epic** challenge :/

* Once you defeat Lich, approach the broken column on the right side of the chamber and examine it to find a note to Gilgamesh and theâ¦

# Leftovers

So you think you're finished? Well, that was just the beginning :)

Completing the challenge gives you the basis for a perfect save, but there are plenty of things still left to do for 100% completion. As a matter of fact, the challenge playthrough was as minimal as possible due to the time limit, so you've probably never had more to do on Disc 4 than now!

Here's a short guide to help you on your way.

## Chocobo Hot&Cold

Your first order of business with this will be to find all the remaining Chocographs and Chocograph Pieces, and dig them up. Also uncover all the Dead Pepper treasures while you're at it.

After that, complete Fat Chocobo's beaches side-quest to get the free healing ability and easy refills of 99 Dead Pepper from one of the Chocobos in the Paradise.

To finish up, work on you mini-game stats:

* Choco's Beak Lv: 99
* Game Played: 9,998 per location (yes, the max is not 9,999)
* Total Points: 99,999

You are given a star in the Chocobo Hot&Cold menu if you reach the points cap.

As for the high score, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact maximum, and pretty much impossible to engineer your score during a game. So I would suggest to just get this as high as you can without paying too much attention to the actual value.

## Maxing Gil

If you want 0 Gil for your perfect save, then stat and EXP maxing will net you enough Gil for all necessary purchases. However, if you want 9,999,999 Gil on top of that, then you will need to put in much more effort.

Although it gets incredibly tedious, the Cotton Robe trick is probably the best way of making Gil. Unfortunately, the only place to get Wrist and Steepled Hat on Disc 4 are Dali and Burmecia, respectively. And unlike Dali's shop, Atla is all the way at the very end of Burmecia, meaning you need to traverse the area twice every time you do the trick. Well, at least it's on the same continent. One round of the Cotton Robe trick yields a little over 60,000 Gil.

The other option would be to fight for your Gil with the Millionaire ability activated. Theoretically the best option would be Gimme Cat at 5,000/7,500 per battle, but there is no way to encounter it exclusively, so Adamantoise is the next best thing at 4,433/6,649. It's the only encounter on Uaho Island (the one with Chocobo's Paradise, and only outside the forest) and is easy and quick to defeat. Fighting Yans will, on average, yield the same amount, but takes longer.

So basically you either keep doing the Cotton Robe Trick or fight over a thousand Adamantoise.

## Maxing stats & experience

I think the following is the fastest possible way of maxing stats and EXP.

First thing to do is have everyone learn the Level Up ability. You can also learn Ability Up so that you can make the post Lv 99 grinding a bit less monotonous with ability learning. Be sure to buy about 50 Tent as well, or you can heal using Choco's beach ability.

Form a party with Zidane, Garnet, Quina and Freya. Have Garnet learn Atomos, Quina Lv5 Death and everyone Auto-Regen, Auto-Haste, Auto-Life and Insomniac. You will also need 46 Amethyst (more isn't necessary) and the Dragon's Hair. I strongly recommend having Freya master Initiative and Quina Millionaire.

Whenever following a character's stat path, start with the set-ups requiring the most Level Ups and finish with the ones needing the least. This makes things easier since you'll initially be gaining about 30 Lv per battle but only about half a Lv towards the end.

Fly to Popos Height above Gizamaluke's Grotto and fight Grand Dragon. Quina will make short work of them with Lv5 Death. Your party should reach Lv 50 within a matter of minutes, after which you will probably quickly realize that Grand Dragon is second-rate. Say your goodbyes and fly to Vile Island, or continue fighting until you've maxed Dragon's Crest since you'll need to do that eventually anyway.

Yan has a terrible reputation, but in the end, with the right strategy the battles come down to luck, and this will turn in your favor with every Lv you gain. Out of the hundreds of battles I fought, I think I only lost 2 or 3.

One thing to note is that Virus doesn't cause you to lose EXP; the EXP the character would have gotten is redistributed among the others, so even if 3 characters have Virus, you're still getting optimal EXP unless the last character already has 9,999,999. As a matter of fact, characters with that much EXP will automatically give up their share of the EXP, so they don't even need Virus. Also, without Virus the can continue learning abilities.

**The strategy:**

Activate everyone's Auto-Regen, Auto-Haste, Auto-Life, and Insomniac as well as Freya's Initiative. Make sure your ATB Mode is set to **wait** - this is very important! The strategy you'll use is the same no matter how many Yan you face, and is as follows:

* Quina casts Night
* Freya opens a menu whenever a party member has an animation
* Zidane Steal
* Garnet summons Atomos
* Freya uses Dragon Breath (or you summon Atomos again)

Once Garnet reaches Lv 80 or so, you can thank Atomos and start using Odin. Change your battle strategy to the following and keep it this way until you finish maxing EXP:

* Quina casts Night
* 4th character opens a menu whenever a party member has an animation
* Zidane Steal
* Garnet summons Odin

**Some notes and explanations:**

The reason you need to cast Night is because otherwise you'll spend hours and hours watching all the Yan counters. Not only that, you would run the risk of getting your characters Snort'ed out of the battle, which can ruin your strategy or even cause a Game Over if you get outnumbered. It is possible for them to Snort out more than 1 character after a summon if more than 1 of the counters ends up being Snort!

You need to abuse the **wait** ATB Mode in order to maximize the amount of turns you get before the Yan wake up. Doing this correctly lets you summon 3 times at Lv 99 before they wake up, compared to summoning once and getting countered because they woke up before the summon animation ended. Not to mention that every Yan will get a turn the moment they wake up, unless you've commanded a second Night *before* they woke up. And you also need to Steal once during all this. That is why **wait** ATB Mode is absolutely essential.

Why would you ever need to summon more than once? The reason is that even though Night has a 100% hit rate, and even though Odin has a 99% hit rate against Yan with Garnet at Lv 99 with 99 Ore, Yan **still** has 9 Magic Evade. The result is that one or more Yan will occasionally evade Night and/or Odin. However, this rarely caused me little more than some longer battles due to counters. I've never needed to summon more than twice to win.

Zidane needs to Steal because:

* You need 99 Elixir and Yan is the only source,
* You need to power up Thievery anyway.

Once a character reaches Lv 99, you can equip them with whatever you like and start learning some abilities to break up the monotony. You can essentially switch out Freya for anyone else even before using Odin by just summoning Atomos twice, but Freya has Initiative and it becomes quite effective as your party gains Lvs.

**â¦but I'd like to keep my Eidolons un-flagged.**

If you want to keep your Eidolons un-flagged, then you will need to follow another strategy. Instead of summoning Atomos and Odin, you can defeat the Yan by using the Masamune's Add Status ability: Doom. Zidane will need to master Soul Blade, and you'll need access to another non-damaging ability with a long animation. Zidane's Annoy is a good choice, but any character's skill can be used as long as it has a long animation.

Start the battles by casting Night. Once all the Yan have fallen asleep, begin using Soul Blade on them one by one until they have all been inflicted with Doom. Make sure you keep a menu open during the Soul Blade animations in order to prevent the Yan from waking up too soon. Once the last Yan is taken care of, use Annoy and chose any open menu. The long animation will let the Doom counters hit 0, thus defeating all the Yan before they can retaliate.

## Tetra Master

This is the bane of the Final Fantasy IX perfect save. It'll take a long time no matter which way you slice it.

Obviously, you'll want 9,999 wins, 0 draws, and 0 losses.

The maximum Collector's Lv is 1,700. Your reward for reaching it is a glitch in the menu which obscures your rank. So you may want to opt for 1,699. In any case, you will need every single card, and they will all need a unique arrow arrangement if you ever want to max out the rank.

The question is: what is the perfect arrow arrangement? There are 256 arrow combinations:

| Arrows | Combinations |
|:------:|:------------:|
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 8 |
| 2 | 28 |
| 3 | 56 |
| 4 | 70 |
| 5 | 56 |
| 6 | 28 |
| 7 | 8 |
| 8 | 1 |
| **Total** | 256 |

How you distribute these arrow combinations among your cards is up to you. You can give your strongest cards the most arrows, give them more cards the higher their card # ,use only the top 100 combinations to ensure that you have the maximum number of total arrows in your collectionâ¦ it's really up to you.

Once you're satisfied with your arrow arrangement, you'll need to max out the statistics of your cards. In order to upgrade a card's rank, it must engage in a card battle and wil - whether it is the attacking or defending card does not matter, though. It is random whether your card's rank rises: the odds of upgrading from P/M to X are 4/256; from X to A it's 2/256. Since arrowless cards cannot engage in card battles, their rank cannot be upgraded. However it is possible to win X-rank cards from the CPU, and therefore possible to obtain an arrowless X-rank card this way.

You get 1 point per X-rank card in your collection, and 2 points per A-rank car. That's how you get the remaining 200 Collector's points after getting 1,500 from having each card with a unique arrow arrangement.

Finally, you will want to max out you card's attack and defense statistics. Each of your 5 playing cards gets 1 point to a random stat once you win the card game. This is added to a hidden total, and this hidden total determines the stats shown on the card. If the random point goes to a stat which is already maxed out, then it is wasted. This, combined with the very high caps on most cards, means you'll need a very long time to max out all of your cards.

The table below lists the maximum stats and default rank for each card:

| # | Name | Stats | # | Name | Stats |
|:-:|------|:-----:|:-:|------|:-----:|
| 001 | Goblin | 0P00 | 051 | Abadon | 7M62 |

| 049 | Malboro | 5M36 | 099 | Boco | 8P77 |
| 050 | Mover | 6MF0 | 100 | Airship | 8P77 |

The old man outside the Treno weapon shop is good for upgrading your cards' rank, because he likes to attack your cards whenever possible, but uses the weakest cards in the game.

Finally, keep in mind that the various airship cards used by the Four-Armed Man will become permanently unavailable once you claim your Rank S Medal from him and he escapes. You can still challenge him for a game of Tetra Master even if you've achieved Rank S - just don't speak to him normally so that you don't initiate the Rank S sequence.

## Side-quests

**The Nero Family side-quest**

You have to return to the Tantalus hideout after each of the following scenes:

* After you've gotten Excalibur II
* After the scene where Zidane steps into the space
* After entering the Crystal World
* After defeating Deathguise

Zidane will then comment about the size of the family, and if you enter the Tantalus hideout, you'll find a chest in the lower left corner containing the Protect Ring. If you did everything correctly then the side-quest will be completed, and no triggers will be left to re-initiate it (which wouldn't be so great since you can't complete it a second time no matter what).

**The Stellazzio coins**

Find and submit all the Stellazzio coins. It's possible to keep all of them in your inventory and get all but the last prize from Queen Stella, but the problem is that the last prize is the one-of-a-kind Hammer. So it's up to you whether to complete this side-quest or not.

**Frog Catching**

Frog catching can take a while, so make sure you spread it out between the other things you'll be doing. The max amount of frogs you can catch is 32,767 so just forget about it. You need 101 frogs to make Quina's Frog Drop deal 9,999 damage at Lv 99. That means you will need to defeat Quale first. If you want to keep him undefeated in your file for whatever reason, then you'll have to keep Frog Drop un-maxed as well.

**The friendly monsters**

Encounter all the friendly monsters and meet their requests. There's no point in keeping any of the gems they give you because they are used for the next friendly monster. The side-quest has a net effect of 0 on your gem inventory. If you defeat Ozma before completing the side-quest, the Friendly Yan will have a different quote.

**The Ragtime Mouse**

Find the Ragtime Mouse and answer all his questions correctly to receive a much-needed Protect Ring.

**Reviving Mognet Central**

Get another by completing the Mognet Central side-quest. Be sure to give Moguta a Kupo Nut for an Aloha T-Shirt *before* doing this side-quest so that you can still get another Kupo Nut for your inventory!

**The secret of the Eidolon Wall**

Discover the secret carved into the Eidolon Wall in Madain Sari. Try to figure it out on your own!

**Treno Weapon Shop**

Defeat Behemoth in the Treno Weapon Shop to finally complete those fights.

**The end of Stiltzkin's adventure**

Purchase Stiltzkin's final deal in Alexandria to get some more unique gems and a Ribbon.

**The King of Jump Rope**

While you're there, you may want to claim the King of Jump Rope key item if you didn't do so back at the start of the challenge. You can try to get this on the first try to have a record of 1,000 for 1st place and 0's for the 2nd and 3rd places. Alternatively, you may want to get 1,000 3 times. The maximum is well above 10,000 so don't even think about itâ¦

## Maxing out your inventory

This can get pretty complicated due to synthesis and the varying amounts you need of each item. Thankfully, you can use [this Excel spreadsheet](http://aladore3viii4.free.fr/files/FF9/IllusionGamer90/FFIX%20Perfect%20Amounts.xlsx) to optimize your buying/synthesizing and minimize traveling back and forth between locations. Thanks to IllusionGamer90 for this tool!

* Gems can be gotten more easily by using Eiko's Jewel spell to accumulate Ore, and synthesizing that with various status cures to get the gems. Aquamarine is gotten by exchanging Ore at a 4:1 ratio at the fountain in Daguerreo. Jewel can be used repeatedly in a single battle until you have 99 Ore.
* You can get the remaining Protect Rings from Chocobo Hot&Cold.
* Phoenix Pinion and Ether can be synthesized at Hades' Legendary Synthesis Shop. However, the only way to get 99 Elixir is to Steal them from Yan.
* The only source of Wing Edge is Crystal Tiamat, which holds 2. Activate Bandit and Master Thief to grab them from the rare slots.
* Don't use the Hammer to synthesize the Tin Armor: the Hammer extends the game's ending and keeping it still allows you to get the Tin Armor at any time.

## Miscellaneous

* Open all remaining chests and search all remaining field icons.
* Trip the traps in Ipsen's Castle. Or not.
* Defeat 7 Tonberry to max out its Everyone's Grudge attack.
* Max out Thievery and Dragon's Crest.
* Since we didn't use any Eidolons during the challenge, all of them will still be un-flagged, i.e. appear in their full animation the first time you summon them (except for Madeen, which is used automatically). You can choose to un-flag the rest, or keep them *untouched*.
* Defeat Quale, Hades, and Ozma.
* Claim the Rank S Medal.
* Finish buying and/or reselling the key items from the Auction House. Also buy the one-time-only Thief Gloves if you didn't do so on Disc 3.
* Upgrade the Treno Thug's selection of cards. Toss 10 Gil into the fountain at the entrance 50 times, and the Thug next to it will gain access to stronger cards. He will say that he bought some new ones after finding the money.
* You can manipulate which character appears on your save file. If your time ends in 00 seconds (XX:XX:00), then Zidane will be on your save icon. If you manage to save your game on a full hour (XX:00:00), it will be Garnet! Steiner and Vivi appear randomly if these conditions are not met.
* For an additional challenge, try to finish your perfect save within 100 hours, before the clock turns red. It's possible to complete everything except maxing the amount of Chocobo Hot&Cold games, and maxing all card stats (but Rank and Collector's Lv **can** be maxed within 100 hours).

# Perfect stats

This section lists all the level up strategies for every character and every stat path. Also included are strategies for the Lv 1 Path in case you ever change your mind on that. Each part has a short description of how the stats actually affect the character in question. The actual equipment to be used will be listed below that, in the following format:

|   | Path | SPR: ?? | STR: ?? | MAG: ?? | SPD: ?? |
|:-:|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| ?? | Weapon | Headgear | Arm Gear | Armor | Add-On |

The numbers next to each set of equipment represent how many **Level Ups** the set is to be equipped for. So, if the number is 9, for example, then have that set of equipment on for 9 Level Ups. This can be from Lv 10 to 19, 67 to 76 or any other Lvs, as long as you keep it on for a total of 9 and **only** 9 Level Ups. You don't need to and sometimes can't equip these equipment sets in order, but as long as each of them is equipped for the listed number of Level Ups, it makes no difference. **T** designates a set-up for Tantarian, **P** a set-up for Pandemonium, **H** stands for Hecteyes, and finally **X** for Quina's training during the **Combined** stats path.

Please keep in mind that these will be your characters' **natural** stats at Lv 99, without any gear equipped. Once you are done with your perfect save, you will have to unequip all the gear from your characters in order to completely fill your item list, leaving only their basic weapon, which everyone should have 2 copies of at the end. Then you will see the stats listed, otherwise you will usually have higher values thanks to equipment.

Due to the way your stats are calculated, Spirit will only reach 50 at around Lv 99 when using these strategies. You'll notice that for many of the set-ups listed you are told to remove Spirit-raising equipment before you even reach 50 Spirit. This is correct, so just follow the steps and everything should work out at Lv 99, or slightly earlier.

Finally, the set-ups illustrated in this section are now **guaranteed** to be the most optimal possible, thanks to them being generated or confirmed by an optimization program written by letao! If, however, you somehow come up with something better, don't hesitate to submit your discovery!

## Zidane

Zidane is obviously a physical attacker, so all of his set-ups will focus on Strength. Speed or Magic are equally useless, but Magic is given priority because at least in theory, it is useful for paying for his Skills. You can also obtain more stat points in total by focusing on Magic than on Speed, and Zidane will still be by far the fastest character in the game.

**Path A**

## Garnet

Garnet's focus is clearly on Magic, especially with her wide selection of damaging summons. However, it should be noted that she does become a pretty good physical attacker as well, especially when given a racket and something which boosts Wind Elem-Atk. That maximizes her physical power and lets her attack from the back row.

**Path A & B**

| 74 | Magic Racket | Holy Miter | Magic Armlet | Minerva's Plate | Pearl Rouge |

## Vivi

Vivi is a simple character stat-wise. Obviously, his set-up will focus on Magic. Like Garnet, Vivi ends up with a little over 50 Strength, but his staves are neither long-range, nor can their power be boosted by element-raising equipment. They do have Add Status properties, though - but Strength doesn't come in handy for that.

## Steiner

This strategy focuses mainly on maxing Steiner's Strength. Although you might think that Steiner's Magic stat is also important due to his Sword Magic abilities, this is not the case. Sword Magic is not a magical attack, it is only a boosted, elemental physical attack. The only thing Steiner's Magic stat is good for is providing MP, which is a bit disappointing. But Sword Magic isn't cheap, so I guess Magic does come in handy.

| 50 | Defender | Kaiser Helm | Venetia Shield | Diamond Armor | Dark Matter |

## Freya

Freya is similar to Steiner in most respects. She is a physical attacker; none of her Dragon skills make use of the Magic stat. Lancer is physical, Dragon Breath depends on the enemy's max and current HP, Cherry Blossom is magical but uses Strength to determine damage, and Dragon's Crest has fixed damage. However, those skills and her others do cost a lot of MP, therefore her set-up will focus on Strength, while still getting as many Magic points as possible along the way.

## Quina

Quina is an odd character, and he/she doesn't really use neither Strength nor Magic. Quina's physical attack damage follows a random formula and only 4 of his/her Blue Magic spells use the Magic stat for damage, 1 of which does random damage anyway (Twister), and 2 of which are hopelessly weak regardless (Goblin Punch and Lv4 Holy). So it's really up to you what you want to focus on stat-wise. Here's an overview:

*Strength*:

* HP is more important than MP and increases the potency of White Wind
* More STR increases the damage cap of Quina's physical attack which is useful with the Counter ability for free damage.
* MP can be made up for with Half MP, MP+10%, and/or Absorb MP, but no such boosts are available for Strength.

*Magic*:

* Quina is above all a Blue *Mage* with Blue *Magic*.
* Party has 4 Strength-oriented characters and 4 Magic-oriented characters
* Earth Shake is a powerful spell.
* Quina can attain a higher maximum Magic than maximum Strength.

*Balanced*:

* Best of both worlds.
* Probably what was intended by the developers.
* No need to make tough decisions.

## Eiko

Eiko is clearly a mage-type character and will be focusing on her Magic stat. She doesn't have as many damaging attacks as Garnet, but she still needs Magic for the MP and for the attacks she does have, namely Holy and Madeen.

**Path A/B/C/Lv1**

**Combined**

|:------:|---|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 01 | Magic Racket | Holy Miter | Power Wrist | Minerva's Plate | Ribbon |
| 09 | Magic Racket | Holy Miter | Magic Armlet | Minerva's Plate | Ribbon |
| 12 | Magic Racket | Holy Miter | Magic Armlet | Robe of Lords | Dark Matter |
| 24 | Magic Racket | Holy Miter | Magic Armlet | Minerva's Plate | Dark Matter |
| 52 | Magic Racket | Holy Miter | Magic Armlet | Robe of Lords | Pearl Rouge |

###### Notes

These results assume that Marcus stayed at Lv 1 while he was in the party. If he gained any Lvs, especially with stat-raising equipment, then some of Eiko's stats may be higher. If you leveled Marcus then it is in your interest to use another set-up, as this one may no longer be optimal. You can use letao's calculator for this.

## Amarant

Amarant is similar to Zidane, except that he has more Level Ups available at the end of the challenge. Just like Zidane, Amarant has absolutely no need for a Magic stat outside of MP; No Mercy is not a magical attack. His moves don't require much MP, either. Strength will be the focus.

# Treasure locations

The following is a list of the locations of all treasures in FFIX, in case you can't find some of them. They are listed by the area in which they appear and then in categorical order; medicinal items are listed first, followed by equipment, gems, cards, key items and finally Gil. The areas are listed in the order in which you first visit them.

An **F** indicates that this is a field icon treasure, a **C** means the item is found in a chest and an **R** means it is received as a reward or by other means. An **\*** indicates that this treasure **can** be picked up on Disc 4 after obtaining the Excalibur II. Finally, a **@** on the map indicates a save point (a moogle, most of the time). Some location names are taken directly from the **location** bar on the bottom of the menu screen, so check it when looking for a treasure.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this challenge possible? How can you do all this in 12 hours?!

Yes, it is possible, and that's why this guide was written. I didn't write a fairy tale, submit it to GameFAQs and have it get accepted. As for the how, I don't know, it simply is; I didn't believe it for a long time myself. Some of the coincidental just barely possible things done during this challenge really make you wonder whether it wasn't somehow intended.

## All of this for a lackluster ultimate weapon?

The point of this challenge is not getting the Excalibur II, it is getting a **perfect save** which **includes** the Excalibur II, which is something completely different. And anyway, you shouldn't be doing this only for the perfect save and the Excalibur II, since this challenge is the most fun part of making a perfect save. It is challenging and tests your skills and limits. The rest is just generic tedium. The Excalibur II is icing on the cake and a mark of your success.

## Can I complete this challenge on the PAL version of FFIX?

Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Not really.

The problem with the PAL version is that the game runs at 50Hz (i.e. a bit slower than the 60Hz NTSC version), but the clock runs at the same speed as in NTSC. In effect, this means that a PAL player will take approximately 12 minutes more for every hour an NTSC player would need. On a scale of 12 hours, that becomes almost 2 and a half hours which a PAL gamer needs to make up somewhere, which is astronomical for this challenge. In the end, a PAL player would need to complete the challenge within around 10 hours instead of 12.

For a very long time, it was considered impossible. However, a user named 2jankku has completed a PAL run and gotten the Excalibur II, with just under 3 minutes to spare.

So what's the catch?

It is a TAS (tool-assisted) run. This means playing on an emulator and using save states to instantly save the game at some crucial points. Zjankku still saved the game normally when required and used save states sparingly, but nonetheless, using save states in the most difficult parts makes getting the perfect run considerably easier (although it was still by no means an easy playthrough!).

So although the PAL playthrough is theoretically possible, in practice, you would need to reset an incredible amount of times. Zjankku also used macros to skip the text automatically (not faster, but it saved him from carpal tunnel syndrome); a luxury which a normal PAL player won't have on real PS2 hardware.

The good news is that Zjankku followed Path C **and** did the 10th Promist Ring detour. So if you prefer to do Path A or B, and/or are willing to skip the 10th Promist Ring, then your chances become much better. But still, there is a reason this was considered impossible for so many years: even without the detour and on a faster stat path, the degree of perfection needed to keep up with NTSC times is most likely unattainable for someone playing on a real PS2.

Of course, you're more than welcome to try and report your results.

However, if you have a cheat device such as Action Replay or GameShark, then you're completely justified in using it to even the odds. Simply play the game until you hit 2:24:00, then save. Use the following code to revert the timer back to 00:00:00:

D0024748 7190
8002473E AC60
```

Now load the game, save again, and reset the console. You can now continue playing normally, and the challenge won't be any easier nor harder than for NTSC players. Please keep in mind, though, that you can't use the target times when playing on PAL. Instead, you have to go by the differences between consecutive target times, and convert this to PAL as well.

## Is it possible to get the Excalibur II by overflowing the timer?

Yes it is, as supposed by Terence and proven by SoftReset. The timer will change in color every 100 hours, but eventually it will *overflow* and the time will start from 00:00:00 once again, as if you just began a new game. Once this happens, go to Excalibur II spot and pick it up before another 12 hours expire.

However, it apparently takes 2 years, 98 days, 12 hours, 6 minutes and 28.25 seconds of real time for the timer to restart. Good luckâ¦ >__>

Regardless, the Excalibur II is meant to be gotten in under 12 hours from the start of the game, so getting it in any other way may be questionable.

## How long does this challenge take overall in real life?

The strategies in this revision have been designed to be as fast, reliable, and consistent as possible in order to reduce the average amount of resetting needed to get acceptable results. That said, you're still very dependent on the game's random number generator. As NBtheGameMaster puts it:

> Ultimately, the random number generator is going to dictate your success and failure rates for every aspect of the challenge from random encounter rates, to rare steals and enemy attacks. I (as well as others) have taken every measure I can to fine tune this guide to make it as reset-friendly as possible, as a good portion of the guide has been derived from my recent run and the playlist of videos that accompany this guide!

With these new strategies and the large buffer times they allow for most stat paths, you can afford to cut a lot of corners and don't need to follow the target times religiously. You can take advantage of the extra buffer at the end of the target times to allow yourself some lateness in the toughest segments, thus preserving your sanity and mental health. You don't need to get a perfect run through every segment, all that matters is that you end up at the Excalibur II by 11:59:59. Every minute you have left after reaching the Excalibur II is potentially an hour or more of wasted reset effort, so always keep that in mind. However, here's an insight from NBtheGameMaster into what it took to get these target times and show that there is indeed a huge buffer:

> For me, it took four complete months (from March 1 - June 30, 2013 to be exact!) to do the challenge for my 3rd time, but I spent at least 4-6 hours a day, 5-6 days a week, and almost twice as many hours on my days off! Sometimes a whole day on just one circuit, so I had to push myself to finish playtesting this newest version as soon as possible! Some circuits took me a few days to get just right, and a few actually took **one** try to get! The final battle with Lich is one of those examples.

So before you start complaining, be happy you're not one of the playtesters!

All in all, there are a lot of factors that play into this, like previous experience with speed runs, with the game itself, and of course luck. I think that with the newest strategies and the considerable buffers, players should be able to reach the Excalibur I within 100-150 real life hours, provided they properly take advantage of the extra time available.

## Is there any way to reduce the number of random encounters?

> As far as random battles go, I have no idea what the mechanics behind them are, except that they always seem to come at the worst possible time.
> *1whoistornapart*

I think that's the only mechanic we can be absolutely sure of! Other than that, changing screens resets the random battle counter, so if you're close to an exit, enter and immediately return even if you're heading to another exit.

The so-called *stop/run* method has been debunked. If you knew what your current encounter check value is at any given time, then this method could be used, but since you don't know the value, using *stop/run* remains just as random as simply moving at all times.

## Can't Vivi or Amarant also absorb Tantarian's EXP?

Of course they can, except that those would be worse choices than either of the current options. Both Vivi and Amarant lose more than either Zidane or Freya by taking the EXP, which is why they are ignored.

It is also pointless to spread the EXP between multiple characters as that awards more Level Ups in total, and therefore results in greater overall stat losses for the party. Giving 1 character all the EXP results in 17 Level Ups, whereas spreading it between 2, 3 or 4 yields 28, 36 and 44 Level Ups, respectively.

## Is there really no way to avoid the EXP in Pandemonium?

No, there isn't. Really. There's no conspiracy. And no, the Abadon during the forced battles cannot use Virus Fly.

## What should be done with the Marcus/Eiko glitch?

It should be ignored. Doing it makes this challenge impossible to complete; you can't get Marcus to Lv 99 and still get the Excalibur II and everything else.

Furthermore, Eiko will not have *perfect* stats if you raise him to Lv 99, she'll simply have un-natural stats. Getting only as many Level Ups as possible without sacrificing the Excalibur II is even worse because the glitch would only be partially exploited and thus you would be left with neither natural nor godly Eiko. If you can't do it all the way, it's better not to do it at all and get Eiko as she is meant to be.

## I can't keep up with the target times. What am I doing wrong?

If you're not playing on a PS2 with the Fast Disc Speed setting turned on, then that's probably the main factor. Other than that, make sure your menu operations are lightning fast, and that your battles end quickly. If a key character gets knocked out and you have to spend time reviving him/her and waiting for their ATB gauge to refill and them to act, then you've probably already lost 30 seconds, if not more. I segments without any battles, your time should not be off by more than around 15 seconds, because there are no random factors which could affect it other than menu operations, dialogue skipping, and simply running from one area to another.

# Credits

Thanks go out to everyone who contributed to the making of this challenge and this guide during its many stages and versions, be it directly or indirectly.

Whether it was through proofreading, commenting, testing or participating in one of the **countless** message board discussions, you've all done something to make this guide what it is today. There is no way I could have managed this all by myself.

**So let's the credits roll! :D**

Very special thanks go out to camdad04, the mastermind behind version X!

The effort you put into this was truly monumental. Best contributor ever! Although I had moved on from this guide some time before, your enthusiasm and creative ideas really made me excited about this challenge again. I will miss the strategy discussions and discoveries.

And if there's anything I'll never forget, it's Ark's 16/256 Holy Lance! :D

To anyone else reading this: give camdad04 a well-deserved nod if you meet him on the message boards!

Thanks go out to IllusionGamer90 for all his support in the tons of strategizing and calculations that went into this update! Equipment, set-ups, damage outputs, skipping Cotton Robe tricksâ¦ the discussions were always exciting. Thanks also for doing not just one, but several test runs on various stat paths, and for editing the update.

If you aren't one yet, then you should consider becoming a crazy scientist :)

Or at least a pro TAS player!

In addition, lots of credit is also due for taking up the challenge of completing the initial revisions so that the test runs could finally be started!

I hope you like my ASCII art of a brain in a jar :)

* Thanks to MorbidDesire and Stunning SteveAustin for their support and assistance during the first stages of this project, without which this guide and this challenge may never have become a reality. Testing this challenge with the two of you was not only productive, but very enjoyable. In particular, thanks go out to Stunning SteveAustin for the emulator FMV-skipping technique. This guide would not have turned out the way it has without you guys and it was a pleasure working with both of you!
* Thanks to 1whoistornapart for inspiring me to test the Lv 1 Game during this challenge with his initial 20 minutes lead at the end of the game. If it wasn't for him, we'd still be playing the *bootleg* Lv 1 Game! Thanks also for the modified Tantarian strategy, and for proof-playing the Lv 1 Game and getting a large lead then, too. Thank you also for helping other players with this challenge and responding to their posts when I didn't have the time. Finally, thank you for setting the video playthrough trend into motion!
* Thanks to aladore384 for finding the maximum in Chocobo H&C, especially the star awarded for getting 99,999 points.
* Thanks to AtmaChild for informing me of Mosh's whereabouts on Disc 4, for the alternative method for evading the Alexandrian Soldier by the cage, for realizing the Observatory Mountain must be visited in order for it to appear on the World Map, for reminding me about the hidden save point after Tiamat, and for a stat set-up for Vivi.
* Thanks to big_kake for finding a way to avoid the EXP gained in Mount Gulug in Version 3, for suggesting to perform an additional round of the Cotton Robe trick on Disc 2 in order to lessen the Gil strain, for the alternative Masked Man strategy, for the Ark preparation strategy, for showing Charge! to be a very powerful move and for proof-playing the Lv 1 Game.
* Thanks to camdad04 for laying the groundwork for the biggest and most complicated update ever. I think if I listed credits at every piece of information, then camdad04 would probably be the most used phrase in this text document. And although the non-physical Ozma battle strategy did not end up being included, it was by far one of the most engaging discussions I've had about this game. I really doubt whether this update would have ever materialized in its present form if it weren't for camdad04 - because I definitely was not up to the task anymore at that point.
* Thanks to Cicatriz_ESP for finding 3 enormous errors in the guide, namely the mistakes made in the bought quantities of Bandana and Zorlin Shape, and the idea that **base** stats-ers can gain EXP whenever they want. Also, thanks for reminding me to mention the stat problems caused by Blank and Marcus, Dark Matter and Pumice from Ozma, and for letting me know that I forgot to include the Ozma Card in the Treasure locations section.
* Thanks to CrAckLeT for coming up with a way for slim-line PS2 users to skip FMVs, and for checking some things on the PS3.
* Thanks to FFDude4Ever for the PAL timer code.
* Thanks to Ekke for being the first person to send me comprehensive feedback and corrections after finishing this challenge. In particular, thanks for the dialogue skipping information, the idea to change the button configuration during the Hippaul Racing mini-game and for pointing out to use Epitaph for preparing the party for the battle against Ark.
* Thanks to Evans Smith for improving Eiko's and Amarant's stat set-ups.
* Thanks to genkaku666 for the detailed information concerning the Festival of the Hunt.
* Thanks to GoldLion91 for an improved Black Waltz #2 strategy.
* Thanks to IllusionGamer90 for a ton of assistance during the version X revision, especially editing in the final peer-reviewed changes! The support went above and beyond anything I ever expected from contributors! Huge thanks also for the item buying spreadsheet and for playtesting the actual guide and providing a solid set of target times! Your enthusiasm for this challenge is extraordinary.
* Thanks to Ins1ghtful for proposing a more effective way to collect the items in the Cleyra's Trunk circuits, and for pointing out an error in the items to be collected.
* Thanks to InvncblGrlnd for wiping the floor with this challenge by getting a 54-minute lead, thus proving that it's even possible to complete without skipping FMVs! And of course, **thanks for the videos**; very cool!
* Thanks to KADFC for his Max Stats Guide; the formulae and lists were useful for creating stat strategies.
* Thanks to Kamy41 for discovering that the Black Mage in Gizamaluke's Grotto does **not** in fact disappear and can still be fought for the final bell even on Disc 4. Yet another discovery almost a decade after this guide was begun.
* Thanks to layzee for pointing out that impressing 100 nobles on the Japanese version of the game rewards only 881 Gil, as opposed to 10,000, and that only 3 Ribbons can be obtained altogether - Stiltzkin doesn't give you one.
* Thanks to letao for being the one to finally put the max stats issue to rest with his comprehensive analysis of stat maxing and the resulting best set-ups, without which we would never be certain whether the ones we were using were really the best. **Huge thanks for the excellent work**!
* Thanks to Louis1980 for improving Zidane's, Quina's Strength-Oriented and Amarant's stat set-ups, as well as for simplifying the set-ups for Zidane Path D, Freya Path D, Quina Magic-Oriented and Quina Balanced. Also, thanks for the explanation of the **pause** trick, for a better way of preparing Zidane for Lucky Seven on the Conde Petie Mountain Path, for suggesting to move the fight against Amdusias to a more opportune time, and for a few other minor corrections. Finally, a big thanks for uploading yet another, possibly the best, master run of this challenge!
* Thanks to Magical_Moogles for a **ton** of discussion on fighting Ozma for the Robe of Lords, for being the go-to source for all things **Combined**, and for providing very in-depth data about Tetra Mater card arrow arrangements.
* Thanks to monkeyslinger for **extensive** assistance on the Version X update, and for answering pretty much every question I had about it. I really don't know how this revision would have come along without your daily help! And most importantly, thank you for stepping in and completing the final set of revisions. The Earth Guardian strategy for getting both items without wasting extra time was also a big help for skipping an extra Cotton Robe trick!
* Thanks to NBtheGameMaster for being one of the first players to playtest the Promist Ring detour and helping to finish the update with that experience. Fortunately, the run was so good that the discovery of the Nero Family side-quest didn't require yet another update! Thanks also for the tracking of abilities learning, the improved Tantarian and Kraken strategies, and of course for testing the end result of the update for consistency and target times!
* Thanks to phileasbu for suggesting to end the Masked Man battle by knocking everyone out in order to increase the number of Steal attempts and thus the chance of getting the Mage Masher.
* Thanks to Ramina for not being afraid to ask questions about this challenge and thus helping to filter out many errors which had snuck into the guide.
* Thanks to rebirth flame 2002 for his Battle Mechanics Guide and his Monster FAQ; I used both of them extensively when planning battle strategies.
* Thanks to Shaun for pointing out that **base** stat-ers don't need to play a true Lv1 Game.
* Thanks to SoftReset for proving how long it takes for the timer to overflow.
* Thanks to SteelShades for proposing the **base** stat idea; it's an interesting alternative solution to the stat dilemma.
* Thanks to SubwoofersIcecream for continually revising the set-ups I and contributors came up with, without whom we would probably be implementing inferior set-ups. In particular, thank you for the current set-ups for Steiner, Path D/E Zidane, Garnet, Freya, and the Magic-Oriented and Balanced set-ups for Quina.
* Thanks to Terence for some Treasure Hunting Rank info, investigating how long it takes for the timer to overflow, for discovering the mechanics behind FFIX's stat system in the first place, and for providing crucial information regarding Ozma's attacks and AI.
* Thanks to themostlazyone for bringing up the issue of the Marcus/Eiko bug, which require clarification, and for an alternative set-up for Freya. Thank you also for testing the Jump Rope mini-game and finding out that 9,999 is not the highest number of attainable jumps.
* Thanks to The_Kusabi_ for *discovering* the Nero Family side-quest! Although it adds even more strain to the challenge, at least you discovered it at the perfect time - before NB finished his playthrough, and before I finished the update! Otherwise the discovery would've brought only resentment :-)
* Thanks to Ultimasamuni for the disc eject trick for the sword fight mini-game! Hundreds of souls have been saved. And I can't believe it took so many years to discover this trick when it was one of the first tricks for evading the soldiers in Alexandria castle.
* Thanks to Vizuino for discovering the 10th Promist Ring, and thus setting a major revision of the guide into motion. I may have hated the work and testing, but the guide is all the better for it today. Also thanks for the arrow manipulation trick!
* Thanks to WampaCow2 for pointing out some omissions in the treasure lists of some of the circuits.
* Thanks to zarathustra47 for proof-reading Version 1 once it came out and informing me of all the little mistakes which eluded my attention.
* Thanks to ZealotBoy for correcting the mistakes I made with the projected values in the Perfect Stats section, as well as the miscalculations I made in Steiner's set-up.
* Thanks to Zjankku for debunking the long-held belief that this challenge was impossible on the PAL version and showing that, at least in theory, it **can** be done.
